      The final edits
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Andddddd, we've arrived to week six: The week I've been waiting for since
      the beginning.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The week where we discuss
      <span class="italic">the single most important element</span> that turns
      average writing into brilliant writing; flat words into emotional ones.
      Because that's what this is all about, isn't it?
      <span class="font-bold">Emotion.</span> Helping your words reach out and
      tap someone on the heart, because this is where real profits lie.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It doesn't matter what you're selling - great brands, great businesses,
      and people who are able to compel large groups of people shape their
      messages by the emotional values that differentiate their offerings from
      the rest—and then use their products to
      <span class="italic">support</span> those values. Not the other way
      around. The naive person takes a product and then tries to shape an
      emotional message around it, but what I hope you've learned, if nothing
      else, is to take the person and shape a message around them. This is how
      we connect to people.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 text-3xl italic">
      Thereafter, buying your product is always a byproduct of first buying into
      your emotional frquency. And so, you've got to set the frequency.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      That's precisely how we're going to wrap The Six Appeal Process—<span
        class="italic"
        >with setting the frequency.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      Throughout the process, you've slaved to understand who you're talking to,
      (the most important part of the process), what they're thinking, and how
      you can use those thoughts to shape your messages.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Now, we're going to talk about how you can further refine and polish those
      messages so they really hit the right emotional cord. Refine and polish
      are the two key words here; you've heard me say that writing is more an
      editing & thinking process than a writing process, and I meant it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The final step, then, in The Six Appeal Process, is editing at the word
      level. We want to take what you're saying,
      <span class="font-bold">and say it better.</span> Once you've got the
      foundation and psychology pieces in place, this is truly the real trick of
      writing with emotion.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      There are four steps to editing at the world level.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So take what you've written so far, and let's roll.
