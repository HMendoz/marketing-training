    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center px-32 italic">
      Every Sunday, we gather together as a family to enjoy each other's
      company, and do the things we don't have time to do during the week. The
      nice stuff. The stuff I wish I had more time for. Stuff like yoga, and
      afternoon drives. I don't know what it is about Sundays, but I always come
      out of one feeling more refreshed; more loved.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">Now read this:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center px-32 italic">
      Sundays are for heart openers. For backbends and lingering. For open
      windows and open minds. For Eggs Benedicts, for barbecues, for sharing
      playlists and for dancing with your invisible top hat to make your little
      sister laugh. For a windows-down drive with Dad, for phone calls from
      Grandma. For home healing and home practice. For cartoons, for gardening,
      for meals we can share. For meditation, for kneeling and praying, for
      mending, for dreaming, for clarifying the murkiness of your mind. For
      rest, for coloring books, for congratulations, and sparkly turquoise nail
      polish. For love, because always for love.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">Did you <span class="italic">feel</span> that?</p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      The first paragraph is okay. It's not even bad. We all wish we had more
      time for yoga and afternoon drives. So I'm halfway there. I'm getting
      inside the reader's head. They're thinking, “Yeah, I wish I had more time
      for that, too.” (And then whatever follows that you're selling, they're
      already primed to buy because they're with your thought process, right?
      Right.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      But the second paragraph is on a whole other level.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The second paragraph makes you desperately yearn for this. The second
      paragraph, by the end of it, has you standing up on a chair, pummeling a
      fist into the air shouting, “Yes! Yes! YES!”...à la Herbal Essences
      commercial. Or weeping into a pillow because all you ever wanted in life
      was love, dammit. :)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Do you know what the difference is?</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      The level of detail.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      They say the devil is in the details, but really? The brilliant writing
      is. And this is similar in theme to what we discussed before about making
      your hook specific, because in the specific story,
      <span class="italic">we find the universal one.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Do I have to love Eggs Benedict to emotionally connect with that post? No.
      Have I ever even tried an Eggs Benedict? Not once! But that doesn't
      matter. Because it's not about the object; it's about the feeling of the
      object.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Let's take another one.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Read this:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center px-32 italic">
      I love coming home to Denver. Even though we're a noisy bunch, you can
      feel the love we have for one another---even as we talk over one another,
      laugh at one another, scream at one another, and exist with one another.
      No matter where I've done or what I've done, my house will always be home,
      with all its quirks and charms---including those of the people who come
      home to it.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">Now read this:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center px-32 italic">
      Deep exhale. I'm home. At Mama and Papa's house in Denver. At this table,
      in this room is where we connect. We've fought, we've cried, we've
      laughed. We've played chess and finished puzzles. We've opened bottles and
      letters, artfully arranged cakes and platters of pasta. We've written in
      journals and opened Christmas presents. We've apologized, we've confessed,
      we've grown. The home that I grew up in and the home I'm creating will
      always be full of life, this way. Not perfect, not pristine...But ALIVE.
      Contrasting and awkwardly shaped and completely BRIGHT in every shade. My
      parents made this room, which would've been the "formal room," the common
      area, no TV, no distractions. Just a table, wine cellars and art. If
      you're going to spend time with the people you love, spend time
      connecting. This is the calm before the storm. In a minute, there will be
      6 loud voices, 6 overlapping conversations, 6 unique stories and 6 sounds
      of laughter all different tones from one another....All different
      perspectives, all different desires and dreams, all sitting at this same
      table. This is my definition of love. ?

    <p class="text-lg">The writing is in the details</p>

    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The writing is in the details.<br />
      It's why J. Peterman, my favorite example on earth to use for brilliant
      writing, is so successful. You know that J. Peterman exists outside of
      Seinfeld, right? Those of you who have taken The Original TMFproject
      Copywriting Workshop know I'm obsessed.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Why?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because no one else in the world can sell a product so well without ever
      showing an actual picture. Except them.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      They sell apparel and unique items found in unique places from around the
      world. And the only product image they show? Is a measly little sketch.
      There are no close-ups. No way to see the fabric. No way to really see
      what you're getting until you get it. And that's part of their allure. The
      treasure. They even have a banner referencing a treasure hunt right on
      their homepage. These guys get it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      1. They know exactly who they're talking to.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      There is no doubt that you're talking to the kind of guy who wants to feel
      like a hot shot. You aren't talking to a guy who crawls into his 9-5 and
      barely whispers a peep before crawling back out at the end of the day.
      You're talking to a mover, a shaker, a wannabe mogul. And so they crafted
      this story to speak directly to that character. “This is what Howard
      Hughes wore the day he bought a restaurant and returned to fire a waiter
      who had been rude.” In other words, you want to have that kind of power?
      You buy this jacket. And you're one step closer.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">1. The story is so specific.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Most people would shy away from telling such a specific story. They'd
      think, “Well, I wouldn't want to alienate anyone who isn't 231 pounds and
      6'6. Or anyone who doesn't know who Howard Hughes is. (I don't, for the
      record.) Or anyone who doesn't have a father. But guess what? This is
      exactly what you need to be doing. In this specific story, we find a
      universal story---a universal message. And because it's specific, we can
      imagine it. And because we can imagine it, we can feel it. And on a much
      deeper level than if they had merely said, “This is a jacket for power
      players. For big boys. For men who mean business.”
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And notice? There's not even a real picture of the damn jacket. THIS is
      what I mean when I say, “What you say is more important than what you
      sell.” Precisely. Right. Here.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So here's what I want you to do. Go back to your piece. And find at least
      one spot where you can insert
      <span class="italic">hyper level detail.</span> The idea here is to take
      blanket ideas and turn them into concrete stories.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">For example:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center italic px-32">
      "You want to be the one in charge."
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">...becomes...</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center italic px-32">
      "You want to walk in and command a room-without doing any commanding.
      Pencils will drop. Pstures will stiffen. And every single person in the
      room will be praying to god they didn't forget to put their phone on
      siletn."
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">You feel the difference?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Let's do another example.</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center italic px-32">
      "Your wedding day shouldn't just be another wedding day. It should be your
      day."<br /><br /><span class="font-normal"
        >(That's pretty common type of statement we see coming and going a lot
        among the wedding photography community, am I right?)</span
