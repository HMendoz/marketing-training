      Recap and introduction
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">Right now, here's the scenario:</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      A visitor gets to your website, reads your book jacket, or sees something
      else you've written. Most of us are under the impression we're writing to
      try and convince, persuade, motivate and sell to whoever happens to have
      their eyes on our paper. But I want to tear that out of your mind, because
      remember:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 text-3xl italic">
      We want nothing to do with folks who have no idea what they want.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Rather, we want to talk to the people who DO know what they want, (i.e.
      what we're selling), and who are highly motivated to buy already - but
      just need help deciding FROM WHOM.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      We talked about this before, but it's worth repeating so you go into this
      lesson with your head in the right place.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Your job is about helping people do what they already want to do.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If you're writing a fantasy fiction book, you aren't going to write a
      teaser or summary that panders to people who are looking for a
      cookbook—and try to convince them why this fantasy fiction story is
      (obviously) so much better than lasagna recipes. That would be ridiculous,
      right? Rather, you're going to write a teaser that taps into the thought
      processes and the desires of those who are already looking for a red hot
      fantasy fiction read, but need to choose one of the thousands in front of
      them on the page at Amazon.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If you're an interior designer, you aren't going to write a homepage that
      panders to people who aren't really sure if they need or want interior
      design---and try to convince them to let you come make love to their
      bathroom. Rather, you're going to write a homepage that taps into the
      thought processes and desires of those who are already looking for an
      interior designer, but need to choose one of the twenty they're scouting
      out in their area. (And therefore, you need to position yourself as the
      perfect fit for the right person.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 text-3xl italic">
      Writing compelling copy isn't about compelling the world to love your
      industry.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Nor is it about compelling your industry to love you. It's about
      compelling the people who already see you…<span class="italic"
        >to choose you.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Now, sometimes you're going to run across a situation where you'll think:
      But nobody even knows about what I do, so they can't possibly be looking
      for it. And that does happen. (Though you'd be surprised - people are
      finding you, even if you think they aren't. Google is magical!)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      But take a music therapist, for example. Not a lot of people know enough
      about music therapy to even think to look for it. So then what?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The key is not in trying to sell music therapy;
      <span class="underline"
        >the key is to sell the outcome of music therapy, and then position the
        music therapy as the solution.</span
      >
      Because there are people already looking for
      <span class="italic">the outcome</span> of music therapy. They just,
      perhaps, don't know that music therapy is an option to get there.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      (And by the way, this is a great example of a time when you should be
      looking outside of your industry to market yourself. I'd make a beeline
      for the mommy bloggers, for example, who have an audience full of hundreds
      of thousands of moms, a decent percentage of which are likely looking for
      solutions to their kids' disruptive behavior—and music therapy might be
      that solution.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Similarly, let's say you're someone who sells canvas prints online. The
      goal is not to sell canvas prints; it's to sell the outcome of buying a
      canvas print, and position the canvas prints themselves as the way to that
      outcome.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So for example, instead of making a statement like:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm italic text-center px-32">
      Our canvas prints are the highest quality in the Tri-State area.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">You might say something like:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm italic text-center px-32">
      If a picture says a thousand words, one of our canvases says a thousand "I
      love yous".
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      The reason I would write something like that is because the target market
      isn't buying a canvas print of their three kids; they're buying a
      statement about themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      <span class="italic">That's</span> the outcome: A statement that they care
      about their family. That they're good mothers. That they love their kids.
      And they're using the canvas print as a medium for expressing that to the
      world, and most importantly, to themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      They're looking to reinforce to themselves that they care about their
      family, that they're good mothers, and that they love their kids. We're
      using a statement to reflect back to them their own identity, and
      reinforce the fact that, yes, by buying this product, you will be a good
      mom.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      The product isn't a product; it's love on canvas.
