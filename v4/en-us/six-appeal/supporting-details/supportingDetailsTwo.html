      Organizing our messaging into a framework
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So we've gone through creating our emotionally drenched Six Appeal
      statements. Now, what?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      You took your ideal customer's thoughts and turned them into Six Appeal
      statements. Now, we want to organize these statements into an intelligent
      skeleton of whatever you're writing, in order to create a psychological
      roller-coaster that continually creates an emotional high for the reader.
      Just when they think they're coming down, you bring them right back up,
      and the final outcome is going to be one big, giant emotional punch in the
      gut.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And if you remember, that's the entire goal of The Six Appeal Process:
      Using words to engineer emotion, because people buy on emotion.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">More emotional punch = More sales.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">So how do we create this skeleton?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      How do we take these statements we've created, and organize them into a
      useful formula that we can actually work with, and use to guide our
      writing?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Let's take our hypothetical canvas printing business and continue to
      workshop it together. In fact, since it was a good line earlier, let's
      name the business <span class="italic">Love on Canvas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The emotional appeal of the name itself generates interest, don't you
      think? Compare that with a name like, “Detroit Canvas Print Shop.” You see
      why I love what I do? How could you not love this game? :)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">So first thing's first:</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Go ahead and open up a blank document.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">Second:</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I want you to take your original hook statement and write it down. We
      worked very hard on that, and we want your hook to take center stage. If
      you've had to go back and edit your hook based on what you've learned in
      the last few lessons, edit away! The hook is designed to do just that:
      Hook. (Line & sinker comes next.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      For example, let's say our original hook statement for our canvas print
      shop was,
      <span class="italic"
        >If a picture says a thousand words, a canvas says a thousand, 'I love
        yous.'</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">Third:</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      After your hook statement, lay out your other Six Appeal statements on the
      page, as if each one were going to be a separate paragraph. The order
      doesn't matter yet—just get 'em on the page.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So if we're workshopping <span class="italic">Love on Canvas,</span> let's
      say my target customer is a busy mother who loves her family but barely
      has time to comb her hair, let alone sit around making scrapbooks and
      hanging out on Pinterest. And so I went through the Six Appeal statement
      exercise and this is what I came up with:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 text-3xl italic">
      The tangible level what they get:
    </p>
    <p class="mb-20 text-center px-32 text-sm">
      A picture printed on a canvas.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-20 text-center px-32 text-3xl italic">
      The benefits level what they get:
    </p>
    <p class="mb-20 text-center px-32 text-sm">
      Original artwork, memories front-and-center, a cool tribute to a loved
      one, a gorgeous wall they love to look at.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-20 text-center px-32 text-3xl italic">
      The Six Appeal level what they get:
    </p>
    <div class="mb-20 text-sm text-center px-32">
      <div>
        <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> I feel like a joke of a human
        because I'm not a Pinterest, craft-loving mom.<br /><span
          class="font-bold"
          >Statement:</span
        >
        Good thing you don't have to be a Pinterest goddess to seem like one.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> I don't have the cash for a big,
        fancy painting---but I need a big fancy something to fill up this
        wall.<br /><span class="font-bold">Statement:</span>

      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> If I see one more thing to say,
        "Keep Calm and Carry On..."<br /><span class="font-bold"
          >Statement:</span
        >
        Rule #1: Never tell a woman to just "Keep Calm and Carry On."
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> I don't want my kids to think
        I'm a bad mother because I didn't put together 800 scrapbooks of their
        childhood.<br /><span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> Scrapbooks put
        your love in the attic. We put your love on the wall.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> I have no idea what to get
        anyone for their birthday, let alone something that makes me look
        charming, thoughtful, loving and creative.<br /><span class="font-bold"
          >Statement:</span
        >
        Put charm, thoughtfulness and creativity on autopilot.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> Picasso was a creepy asshole.<br /><span
          class="font-bold"
          >Statement:</span
        >
        Good news! You can (finally) stop pretending to like Picasso.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> Screw you, Mrs. Jones. I might
        not have a huge reindeer display on the roof at Christmas, and I might
        forget everybody's birthday, but at least I've got a big, giant canvas
        printed picture of my kids hung smack dab in the dining room. TOP
        THAT.<br /><span class="font-bold">Statement:</span>
        Make the Jone's keep up with you.
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So from here, I'll just take the statements themselves, and lay those out
      on the page.
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center px-32 italic">
      If a picture says a thousand words, a canvas says a thousand, "I love
      yous."<br /><br />Good thing you don't have to be a Pinterest goddess to
      seem like one.<br /><br />The best artwork doesn't have to cost like
      artwork.<br /><br />Rule #1: Never tell a woman to just "Keep Calm and
      Carry On."<br /><br />Scrapbooks put your love in the attic. We put your
      love on the wall.<br /><br />Put charm, thoughtfulness and creative on
      autopilot.<br /><br />Good news! You can (finally) stop pretending to like
      Picasso.<br /><br />Make the Jone's keep up with you.
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg font-bold">Fourth:</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Now we want to organize our messages in a logical, intelligent order that
      naturally builds off the hook, reinforces that main theme, goes in the
      order of most hard-hitting to least hard-hitting, (whereby “least
      important” is defined as “most trivial”), and feels like a conversation
      should unfold.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So in this case, the hook is, “If a picture says a thousand words, a
      canvas says a thousand, “I love yous,” and reflects the main theme of
      canvas = love, right? That's what our target is really buying: The ability
      to showcase their love in a way that makes them look good.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So I'm going to rearrange the Six Appeal statements in a way that builds
      off that hook, reinforces that main message in a logical, cohesive
      fashion, from most hard-hitting to least hard-hitting, considering, once
      again, the worldview of my reader. (BUT then ending with the message that
      sums it up quite nicely.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Since the first sentence and the last sentence of anything are THE most
      important of any piece, you'll be more judged by the last sentence you
      write than you will the entire body of what you've written, so we want to
      take very good care of these elements. It's why I've made you examine and
      re-examine your hook so many times. And it's why, using this new
      information, I expect you to go back and re-examine it again. I know this
      stuff isn't easy, but if you want your words to sell for you, they can't
      be lazy, and neither can you.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So as the proprietor of our imaginary business,
      <span class="italic">Love On Canvas,</span> here's how I would re-organize
      my Six Appeal statements in a way that builds off the hook, reinforces the
      main message of that hook, in the order of most important to least
      important, and ending with a bang that sums it all up nicely:
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center px-32 italic">
      If a picture says a thousand words, a canvas a thousand, "I love yous."<br /><br />Put
      charm, thoughtfulness and creativity on autopilot.<br /><br />Good thing
      you don't have to be a Pinterest goddess to seem like one.<br /><br />Scrapbooks
      put your love in the attic. We put your love on the wall.<br /><br />Rule
      #1: Never tell a woman to just "Keep Calm and Carry On."<br /><br />Good
      news! You can (finally) stop pretending to like Picasso.<br /><br />Make
      the Jone's keep up with you.
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So for example, I listed, “The best artwork doesn't have to cost like
      artwork,” towards the end because right now, when tapping into a theme of
      demonstrating love, cost isn't taking center stage.
      <span class="font-bold"
        >First we want to pull on emotional heart strings, ultimately leaving
        the more “rational” points</span
      >
      until later.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      This is even more important once you know that studies show—guess
      what?—<span class="underline"
        >you're going to be lucky if most readers read 20% of whatever you're
        writing</span
      >. So you always, always need to front load your best, most hard-hitting
      emotional messages.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      This is why, surprise surprise, I went ahead and listed the statement,
      “Scrapbooks put your love in the attic. We put your love on the wall” as
      number three, and not immediately following the hook. Because while it
      would seem to nicely foray into the love theme, it's not our most
      hard-hitting emotional message.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And this is where a little subjective judgment comes in handy—and maybe
      even split testing your copy if you want to take it a step further. While
      obviously the idea is to know your target as well as you can so you can
      predict which messages are going to be the most hard-hitting for them,
      it's not always going to be that easy. You're going to have to make some
      judgment calls, and you're going to have to tweak as you go.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      In the meantime, The Six Appeal Process can give you the framework for
      developing your messaging and fleshing it out in ways that, using the best
      of your knowledge, are intelligently designed for emotion.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      That said? There's no substitute for actively seeking out that knowledge
      and confirming your insights.
