      Adapting this framework for multiple purposes
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Since you can apply The Six Appeal Process to anything you're writing,
      (with a goal of a sale of some sort), then it follows that I can't give
      you an exact sentence-by-sentence of what you should write next. That will
      depend on what the purpose of your writing is.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      But what you want to do is take the messaging and the logical supporting
      points we've laid out, and use these to guide your prose.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Do you have to use every single emotional high point?
      <span class="font-bold">No.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Do you have to talk about every single logical point under each high
      point? <span class="font-bold">No</span>
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Can you focus on only one for a message?
      <span class="font-bold">Sure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      How you use this messaging is going to depend on what you're writing, and
      the perception you want to give your reader.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If you're writing a homepage, maybe you select the most salient, (like the
      hook), and use that to guide your main homepage message.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      If a picture says a thousand words, a canvas says a thousand, "I love
      yous."<br /><br />
      <span class="italic text-sm"
        >Got plenty of love, but not plenty of time?<br /><span
          class="font-bold"
          >We've got your saving grace.</span
        ></span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      If you're writing a Company About Page, maybe you use some emotional high
      points and, in between, strategically plant the logical points you've
      outlined.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic">
      Put thoughtfulness an autopilot. (While you sit back and enjoy a Cab Saw.)
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center italic text-sm px-32">
      You always try to be the thoughtful one. The one who clearly pays
      attention, who listens to other people speak, and who reaps oodles of
      brownie points when it's gift-giving season...again.<br /><br />There's
      just one problem: Thoughtful takes time. It takes energy. It takes
      creativity. It takes ideas. (And probably a glue gun.) Right?

    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic">
      Goood news. turns out, you don't have to be a Pinterest goddess to seem
      like one.

      Welcome to Love On Canvas, the print technology company that makes you
      look good, even when it's hard.<br /><br />We take your photographs-even
      the torn, stained ones-and turn them into works of art you'll be proud to
      give as gifts. (Or keep shamelessly for yourself.)<br /><br />Every woman
      is different in the way she loves. And she should be different in the way
      she gives.
    </div>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic">
      And best of all? Art doesn't have to cost like artwork.
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center italic text-sm px-32">
      If "love don't cost a thing", then buying a piece of it to put on your
      wall, (or somebody else's), only costs a smidge more.<br /><br />But
      that's okay, because this year going to let the Jones family have the
      generic Picasso...as they scramble to try and keep up
      <span class="font-bold">with you.</span>
      gives.
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      If you're writing a Personal About Page, maybe you use all of the
      emotional high points and, in between, tell your story as logical points
      that support your statements.

    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center italic text-sm px-32">
      "I don't have time" came out of my mouth more often than any good mom
      should admit.<br /><br />I didn't mean to ignore them. I didn't mean to
      always be in a rush. But I did, and I was.<br /><br />I longed for the
      time leisurely lounge around making arts and creafts, baking cookies and
      putting Martha Stewart to shame. (Can you imagine putting Martha Stewart
      to shame?)<br /><br />But since thoughtfulness and creativity always took
      (too much) time, I thought I was destined to be one of those Spaghetti-O
      moms, haphazardly throwing all our old photos into a shoebox, wrapping'er
      up with duct tape, 'til death do us part.<br /><br />that is, until
      discovered---surprise---you don't always have to be one of those Pinterest
      goddess to seem like one.<br /><br />Because, you see, there's this little
      thing called technology...
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">...etc.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If you're writing a condensed bio, maybe you figure out a way to combine
      several of the emotional high point messaging into one or two really
      hard-hitting sentences that pull it all together.
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center italic text-sm px-32">
      Love On Canvas puts thoughtfulness on autopilot, helps you look like a
      crafty, creative Pinterest Goddess (even when you aren't one), and creates
      photo-inspired canvas art & gifts that will make even the Jones Family?
      <span class="font-bold">Scramble to keep up with you.</span>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Furthermore, if you're writing a book summary, maybe you use the emotional
      high points to guide & narrow the frame of the summary. Or if you're
      writing a cover letter, maybe you use the emotional high points that will
      appeal to the interviewer / company as an outline and then fill in with
      your experience in those areas.

    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The Six Appeal steps are adaptable to help you reach almost any end
      result, as long as you put thought into your words—and emotional
      messaging/logical supporting system—from the start.
