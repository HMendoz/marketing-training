      Fleshing out supporting content around your message
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So we've gone through creating our emotionally drenched Six Appeal
      statements.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Now, what?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Well, it depends. If you've already got something you've written and
      you're editing for Six Appeal, then you want to take these statements and
      work them into your message. On the other hand, if you're starting from
      scratch, you might use these statements to form the mini-thesis for each
      paragraph, in the order you listed them, and then flesh out the supporting
      logical content around the emotional high points.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Our goal here is to create an emotional roller coaster that hits on
      various different emotional high notes. But hitting emotional high notes
      isn't enough, because shockingly, we aren't all a bunch of zombies walking
      around mindlessly just clicking buttons as soon as our pulses rise.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      What we need in addition to our high note emotional messaging is
      supportive, “logical” messaging to mix in, too, so your target has
      something to feed their brains—not just their hearts. Because while the
      heart is most important, we all want to feel like we're making smart
      choices, too. And in order to feel that way, we've got to use facts and
      logic to support the big picture emotional messages.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      There isn't a magical number of supporting points you want to make under
      each emotional message—I've simply used three here for the sake of
      ease—but what you DO want to achieve is setting up the whole shebang so
      the last logical point you're making naturally transitions your reader
      into the next emotional high. That way, your writing won't feel
      discombobulated and disjointed.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So let's brainstorm some supporting “logic” points that will support our
      big, lofty emotional appeal statements. We're going to create the backbone
      of our message.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      For our <span class="italic">Love On Canvas</span> example, here are some
      supporting logic points I might list under each emotional high. (And don't
      worry about making complete sentences that flow perfectly just yet—just
      get the ideas down.)

        3. You don't alaways have the time to express it. (You could even do
        some research and include a fact about working mothers and how they're
        being pulled in every direction at once, so ultimately, you make her
        feel better for ther erratic lifestyle, and support her current
        indentity.)

      Do you see how the last point under each lends itself to flowing right
      into the next emotional high point? That's intentional. Yes, by golly, you
      do have to think about this stuff. :)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And remember: There is no (life or death) magic bullet formula. There are
      no “right answers.” And you have the power to tweak your message as much
      as you need to over time. But the idea is to give you a strong starting
      foundation to help you take the thoughts of your ideal customer and
      client, turn them into the words they need to read, (even if they don't
      know it), and encourage your odds to get them to take the action you'd
      like them to. That's copywriting—and why copywriters get paid more than
      any other writer out there. Because there's a lot that goes into it, and
      it's not just writing pretty sentences.
