      Reverse engineering
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Now, what we want to do is take thoughts, and use them to help us from our
      messages.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      f for any reason you're still struggling, and you don't know your target
      market well enough to be able to imagine their thoughts, try this: Go into
      Amazon, look up related products, and study the reviews. Even if you're
      selling a service or an idea.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Actually, even if you aren't having trouble imagining their thoughts,
      doing this will provide some excellent intel for you, because we don't
      want to tell them what we think; we want to tell them what they think.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6 font-bold">
      And in order to do that, we must have a good understanding of how they
      think.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So if you're selling a product, it's easy enough to hop on Amazon and
      study some reviews of similar products. You'll find out what people in
      general think, but what you want to look out for is what the people you
      are targeting think.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      On the other hand, if you're selling a service, look up some books that
      are related to the service you're selling, even if they aren't an exact
      match, and read those reviews. Read what people actually SAY. It'll give
      you a surprising amount of insight into how they think.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So now we want to take those thoughts, and use them to reverse engineer
      our messaging. How can we reverse engineer those into declarative
      statements that take a person's thoughts, and position what we're selling
      as the answer?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Let's return, once again, to our beloved X6 example. If these were the
      thoughts I imagined my target to have, then how can we translate these
      into declarative statements that take the thought, and position what we're
      selling as the answer?
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm px-32">
      <p>
        <span class="font-bold">Tought:</span> For all the people from my
        hometown who called me trailer trash behind my back.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> They might whisper things
        behind your back. But...wouldn't you?
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      In this case, we wanto to position the X6 as something along the lines of,
      "Let's give'em something to talk about."
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm px-32">
      <p><span class="font-bold">Tought:</span> Who's laughing now?</p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> Who's laughing now?
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      In this case, the thought could be the statement. If you saw a picture of
      an X6 next to simply the words, “Who's laughing now?” might that have more
      impact than, “The X6 will make successful a reality”—which would be the
      typical benefits-driven flatlined statement you'd normally get.
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm px-32">
      <p>
        <span class="font-bold">Tought:</span> I knew all my hard work would pay
        off eventually.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> Hard work isn't a luxury. It's
        how you're built.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      This statement accomplishes two things: Speaks to my worldview and how it
      influences my identity, and also speaks to the car, and how luxury cars
      aren't necessarily for fancy people. They're for hard workers like me.
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm px-32">
      <p>
        <span class="font-bold">Tought:</span> You really do reap what you sow.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> You made your bed. Now drive
        it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      This statement speaks to the “reap what you sow” concept, but doesn't come
      out and directly say “you reap what you sow” because it's a common
      statement and therefore won't Page 88 of 145 force the brain to pay
      attention. So I added a little unexpected phrasing here, pairing “You made
      your bed” with “Now drive it.”
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm px-32">
      <p>
        <span class="font-bold">Tought:</span> I might not have the perfect
        body, but at least I've got this.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> People aren't perfect. But
        when you own an X6, you don't have to be.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Do you see how this is like a fun matching game? Taking your ideal target
      reader's thoughts, and translating them into a phrase that's going to hit
      'em where it hurts, so to speak. You want their thoughts to influence your
      words.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Notice that any one of these could also serve as a hook. ;) The idea of
      this entire step, however, isn't just to refine your hook; it's to develop
      the foundational pieces of your messaging as a whole that you can weave
      throughout your regular copy
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So before moving on, let's take another example and talk about our lovely
      super woman who has created the DIY wreath-making kit.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      As we discussed prior, the worldview that'll be the most relevant for our
      super woman to focus on is the worldview of her target market that's going
      to intersect most with her product.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Something I pointed out prior as being relevant might be, for example, the
      worldview on what it means to be a successful woman. Naturally, we ideally
      want to target a reader who is going to support the worldview that being a
      successful woman means hand made, means quality, means time with your
      family, means appreciating the little things in life, means slow living.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So when that target is considering buying a DIY wreath making kit, maybe
      she's thinking:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm italic text-center px-32">
      This wwill really help me bond with the kids.<br />Our kids will have this
      forever.<br />I can make these and give them to be in-laws as gifts - and
      bonus - it'll make me look like a good wife.<br />What better way for us
      to spend a Sunday?<br />These are the kinds of things that really matter.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So once I outline some of my target's thoughts, I can use those thoughts
      to make some declarative statements:
    </p>
    <div class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center">
      <div>
        <p>
          <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> This will really help me bond
          with the kids.<br /><span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> Bonding
          has never been easier.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <p>
          <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> Pur kids will have this
          forever<br /><span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> Diamonds aren't
          forever. memories are.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <p>
          <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> I can make these and give them
          to the in-laws as gifts - and bonus - it'll make me look like a good
          wife.<br /><span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> They already
          think you're a good wife. This just proves it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <p>
          <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> What better way for us to
          spend a Sunday?<br /><span class="font-bold">Statement:</span> Sundays
          were made for things like this.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        <p>
          <span class="font-bold">Thought:</span> TThese are the kinds of things
          that really matter.<br /><span class="font-bold">Statement:</span>
          Don't forget to pencil in love.
