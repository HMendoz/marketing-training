      Organizing your messaging
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Now, how can we organize those declarative statements into a meaningful
      hierarchy that builds to a crescendo of emotion?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Once you've brainstormed, translated, written, rewritten, and rewritten
      some more, you'll finally be left with a handful of powerhouse messages
      that are related to what you're selling, and designed to appeal to your
      ideal target reader.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">So now what?</p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      Now, we put them to work. We weave them into your messaging in thoughtful,
      deliberate ways.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl text-center italic px-32">
      No matter what you're writing, one thing never changes: You need to keep
      their attention.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      ight? Right. As we've talked about, the goal of the first sentence is to
      get them to read the next sentence, and the goal of that sentence is to
      get them to read the one after that
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      So what we need to do is take these messages and organize them into a
      storyline of sorts, where right after they're coming down from one
      emotional high, you smack them with another one.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      We want to create an ongoing tidal wave of emotion throughout the entirety
      of whatever you're writing, whether it's as long as an entire blog post,
      or as short as a product description.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Once we get our messaging, it's merely a matter of delicately arranging
      them throughout, filling in the blanks, and then editing down to a
      detailed level, ensuring that every single word works together to support
      your sentence, and every single sentence works together to support your
      message, and every single message works together to support your sales.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And that, ladies and gentleman, is how you create Six Appeal.
