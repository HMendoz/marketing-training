      What do you want your writing <span class="italic">to do?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So you're writing something. Now let's talk about what you want that
      something <span class="italic">to accomplish.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Now, the obvious answer here is: We want a sale. A sale of some sort,
      whether it's a financial transaction, or even just getting someone to
      opt-in to your website. When you get someone to take an action, that's a
      form of a sale. No matter what the action is.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So from the reader's perspective, what's the point of reading what you
      wrote and taking the action that you want them to? What do they get if
      they buy into your writing? Into you? Into what you're selling?
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6 font-bold">There are three levels here:</p>
    <ol class="mt-20 mb-20 px-32 text-sm" type="1">
      <li>The tangible level what they get.</li>
      <li class="mt-3">The benefits level what they get.</li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        Associate you and your brand with this gorgeous new fascination.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">The Six Appeal level what they get.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-lg">
      The tangible level stuff is easy. It's the obvious stuff. They get the
      cookbook. The photographs. The web design. The writing. The coaching. The
      time. The advice. The insight. The idea. The entertainment. The
      experience. The memories. The hand-painted necklace.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      For example, I might hire a professional photographer because I want the
      tangible headshots, yes, but on a benefits level it isn't about the
      headshots, but what the headshots do for me. The benefits of having the
      headshots might be about feeling more confident that I'll succeed in
      business because I look more professional. More successful. More with it.
      More legitimate. More aesthetically...pleasing.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      You've probably heard the whole features versus benefits discussion
      before; it's a generally accepted principle of copywriting that you should
      sell people on the benefits of something, rather than the features. You
      get it. This is nothing new. In other words, you aren't selling headshots;
      you're selling confidence. That's the difference between a feature and a
      benefit, and it's the difference between the surface level what they get
      and the benefits level what they get. Check.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      But—and this is a big but—now I want to ask you to take it a step even
      further.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because emotional messages don't stop at the benefits—contrary to common
      practice. That's where most people stop—even copywriters. But lazy
      thinking leads to lazy writing. Benefits Page 79 of 145 are just the
      beginning of the conversation, because they aren't strong enough to
      inspire any real emotion. And, if you'll recall, people buy what they
      love, not what they need. Or, as commonly cited, “People buy on emotion
      and justify with logic.” So it's our job to inspire that emotion, come
      hell or high water.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Back to the car metaphor! Are you excited?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      Take a shiny white BMW X6 for example. If you were to buy this car, the
      surface level what you get is the shiny white BMW itself.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Take it a step further, and the benefits level what you get is prestige. A
      lot of marketing experts will tell you to sell prestige, not a car.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And certainly there's a layer of truth there, but tell me something: If I
      tell you that you should buy a BMW because you're going to feel
      prestigious, does that do anything for you?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      Do the words themselves do abything for you?
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      While the concept itself is valid, we still need to develop better ways to
      put this into words.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So the average person writing this might stick with the benefits, throwing
      a bunch of adjectives in the big copper pot. They'll tell you that buying
      a BMW X6 will make you feel proud. More manly.
      <span class="font-bold"
        >More womanly. More adventurous. More mysterious. More successful. More
        sexy</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Sure, those things are nice.</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      But nice doesn't evoke emotion.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      These words are <span class="italic">flatlining the message.</span> We
      need to take it a step further and delve into the
      <span class="underline">psychological benefits.</span> This is also, in
      part, where the rest of the copywriting world falters— they only go so
      deep. Their benefits are still too close to surface level.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      We need to go deeper. We need to go to the third level: The Six Appeal
      Level
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Otherwise known as the psychological level. Again, this is why we spent so
      much time analyzing our readers' worldviews and perceptions prior to
      putting a single word on the page. Because we need to know what they think
      about themselves, in order to understand what they think, period. (And how
      to perch ourselves nicely in their minds.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So back to our car-tastic white shiny BMW example.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      On a tangible level, what I get is a white BMW. On a benefits level, what
      I get is feeling more successful. More sexy. More adventurous.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      BUT—what I really care about is how owning an X6 will complement my
      perceptions of myself, and my identity to the outside world—whether I
      recognize that to be a fact or not.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because even though plenty of people say they don't care what the world
      thinks, they do. In fact, it's impossible for them not to. As social
      creatures, we're hardwired not only to care what the others think, but to
      seek their approval. To be seen by them. To be understood by them. We
      actually crave their judgment.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      This is where benefits fall flat, because benefits are usually just a pile
      of lifeless adjectives that, when you put them on paper, still feel
      generic.
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm" type="1">
      <li>"Successful."</li>
      <li class="mt-3">"Sexy."</li>
      <li class="mt-3">"Adventurous."</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      Benefits-driven adjectives like these don't feel specific to our
      experience. and therefore we don't feel them.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">Show, don't tell with your writing.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Remember that?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Here's where showing, not telling, becomes the deal maker—and breaker.
      Because to understand what we're selling on the third, final, and most
      important psychological Six Appeal level? We need to slice open our
      readers' minds and spill their thoughts onto the page in their natural
      form—not through words (like adjectives) that represent their thoughts
      (telling), but via their actual thoughts (showing). Which, on all
      accounts, are thoughts that, once we read them, we will feel ourselves.
      And that's precisely the idea.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So. let's say I'm the show off how the X6 test drives. *wide grin*
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      One of my personal world views is that hard work trumps luck. This is
      evidenced by the way I run my business, and how I show up in the world. In
      fact, most entrepreneurs tend to maintain this mindset. We don't care much
      for fate, and we believe our individual efforts will pay off. It's why we
      obsessively chase after every new shiny object—because we actually believe
      we can have it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So taking that into account, if I were test driving an X6, here's what I
      might be thinking:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm italic text-center px-32">
      For all the people from my hometown who called me trailer trash behind my
      back.<br />Who's laughing now?<br />I knew all my hard work would pay off
      eventually.<br />You really do reap what you sow.<br />I might not have
      the perfect body, but at least I've got this.<br />If my mom could onlyh
      see me now.<br />She would have died over this car.<br />Okay, that was a
      bad joke.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Can you see my worldview reflected in those thoughts? I clearly believe
      that hard work trumps luck, and that circumstances are within our control.
      I don't believe that a higher power is responsible for my happenstance; I
      believe that I'm in control of my fate. And as a result, these might be
      some of the things I'm thinking about when debating whether or not to buy
      an X6.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      However, what if my worldview were slightly different? Perhaps I strongly
      believed in fate. In destiny. In karma. And perhaps I put more value on
      God's plan, say, than my plan? How might that change what I'm thinking
      while I'm test driving an X6, debating whether or not to buy it?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Well, perhaps when test driving the X6, the dialogue in my head goes a
      little more like:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm italic text-center px-32">
      Lucky me!<br />I'm so grateful for the apportunities I've been given.<br />Karma
      is a beautiful thing.<br />I knew being a good person would pay off
      eventually.<br />Can you see the difference in worldview coming out in
      these statemens? The first series of statements was centered on a
      worldview that we, as individuals, have ultimate control over our
      destinies-and if I'm able to purchase this X6, it's because I worked hard
      to achieve the right. And the second was centered on a worldview that
      believed that fate is in control, and if I'm able to purchase this X6,
      it's because karma did me good, and I've been lucky in life.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Now, naturally, this is just one example using one type of worldview as
      the angle. There are many world views, and you'll have to select the ones
      that are going to best help you imagine the perception that your target
      reader is going to have as it relates to what you're selling.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The worldview on individual effort versus fate applies here because it's
      going to drive my decision-making process on whether I actually need an
      X6, or can happily settle for a Subaru.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Similarly, if you're selling a DIY wreath-making kit, you'd have to
      consider the different world views of the folks most likely to buy
      this—your target—and tease out the world views that will make a difference
      in their decision-making process.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Perhaps a relevant world view to consider here is the target's beliefs on
      what the definition of a successful woman looks like. Does a successful
      woman look like one who goes out and builds a high-powered career so she
      can provide for her family? Or does a successful woman look like one who
      stays home and focuses on being with her family? You can guess the
      worldview you're going to want to support here. And in turn, those world
      views are going to influence the thoughts you're imagining running through
      their heads when they're contemplating buying your DIY wreath-making
      kit—and furthermore, what we're going to SAY to them, then, to support
      those thoughts.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">That's where we're going next.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      We're going to learn how to take your target readers' thoughts and use
      them to form the structure of your messaging. And we need that messaging
      to line up with the world views and belief system of your ideal customer.
      This is about the art of positioning; you can't get in the right position
      if you don't know where you stand in relation to it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      Ultimately, this all comes down to shared human experience.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      When we read something, we're secretly reading to find a piece of
      ourselves in the stories of others.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      We're looking hard to validate our own existence, that the things we feel,
      we think, we imagine.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      We're looking to feel like they aren't just things we experience in
      isolation, but together as humans-especially the things that aren't talked
      about very often.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's why the blog pst you read that reveals that raw truth about being an
      alcoholic is so seductive.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Not because we're all a bunch of alcoholics, but because we all have our
      own demons we battle with, and on some level, we've all felt the same
      pain. Reading that reinforces our own identity and makes us feel okay
      about being who we are. It makes us feel okay about our past decisions.
      And it makes us feel okay about being us.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So as a result, we SHARE that piece of writing on the internet, in an
      effort to show the world who we are, and what we represent. We feel a
      special bond with the writer, a person we've never met beyond their words
      on a page. And we develop an emotional connection with their writing---and
      them. Because we developed an emotional connection with their experience.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      A person's thoughts shape their experience.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And so these are the thoughts we must use to guide our writing. Because
      ultimately, the words you choose to say to them need to reflect their
      experience back to them, and position yourself as a logical piece among it
      that seamlessly fits in.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because if you're selling a person on themselves, then what you're really
      selling them on?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      Is their own thoughts.
    </p>
