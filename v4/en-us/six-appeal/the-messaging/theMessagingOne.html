      Introduction
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Now it's time to start writing. (I know you're excited, right?)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Most people, when they begin to write something, try the timeless approach
      of sitting down at the computer, thinking of what they want to say, and
      then trying to say it. But as you can probably attest, it isn't that
      simple, nor is it the most effective. We want more strategy than that. We
      don't want to throw any words up against the wall to see what sticks; we
      want to throw <span class="italic">carefully constructed</span> words
      against the wall, already having an educated guess about what's going to
      stick.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And in order to do that, we've got to engineer our words just like you'd
      engineer a machine â€”logically,
      <span class="underline"
        >and in a way that supports what you want the machine to do.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      Machines don't exist for the sake of it, and neither should your writing.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 text-3xl italic">
      Therefore, in order to start, we need to begin at the end.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      We need to understand what the final outcome is, and then work backwards.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's kind of like driving; you have to know where you're going in order to
      steer the car to your intended destination. (This is not the last of my
      car metaphorsl just you wait.)
