      Why lesson one was so darn hard
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So lesson one was a lot more difficult than you probably expected. Wasn't
      it?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">I actually have a secret to tell you.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Are you ready?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Here it is:
      <span class="italic"
        >That wasn't the real step one of The Six Appeal Process.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I intentionally didn't give you the REAL first step, and sent you straight
      to the second step, which is why you had so much trouble finding your
      hook.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">*Ducks and covers head from flying objects.*</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      BUT before you start throwing tomatoes,
      <span class="underline"
        >you need to know that I did it for you in order to demonstrate the most
        crucial piece of the whole process.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I knew it would be close to impossible for you to accomplish what I was
      asking you to do— develop a hook—without first having a very clear
      understanding of who you're developing it for. (For what it's worth, I
      knew you would try to do it anyway.)
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      Understanding your reader's perspective is so incredibly crucial, yet had
      I started off with that, I guarantee you would have thought it was “the
      fluffy stuff” and skimmed right over it. I get it. You wanted to get to
      the good parts, right? The part where you WRITE something? (This isn't my
      first time in this rodeo - I'm onto you guys!)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Well, good news in tennis shoes, Gonzalez! (My high school Calculus
      teacher used to say that phrase; I never understood it, but I think I
      should pass it on). I hope that doing it this way actually cemented
      something in your mind far more than I ever could have, simply by telling
      you about it. That something is this:

      No matter what you're selling, the most important thing you need to
      understand, as intimately as your underwear, is who you're selling it to.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's most frankly impossible to write
      <span class="italic">anything</span> that could make anyone fall in love
      with you, without first having an intimate understanding of
      <span class="italic">who that person is</span>—and how to push their
      buttons.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If you look back, you probably had trouble trying to pick out one specific
      point that you wanted to illustrate or highlight, and figuring out where
      to start. And while it pains me to think about you going through that
      process - wink - it was necessary for you to feel the pain of writing in
      the dark. Because that's how most of us sit down to write, isn't it?

      the message <span class="italic">is intended for</span>.
