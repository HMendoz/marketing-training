      Worldview and worlds
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      When I did my graduate work in Applied Linguistics, I studied the
      intersection of language and worldview extensively, and to what extent one
      affected the other.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Allow me to get academic on you for a moment. (This is when I put on my
      funky black glasses.) There's a theory in linguistics that posits that the
      grammatical structure of your native language, (or, how you arrange words
      into sentences), will forever affect your worldview, and furthermore, how
      you perceive everything that ever happens to you, from here forevermore.
      The theory is called Linguistic Relativity, and it encompasses the idea
      that the language you speak largely influences your thoughts. Furthermore,
      there's also Linguistic Determinism, which says your language DETERMINES
      your thought entirely. It's akin to imagining your language as a prison,
      with your brain held as prisoner. In other words, your thoughts, ideas and
      worldview are limited by what your language
      <span class="italic">allows</span> you to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      For example, the language you speak, and the way you use past, present,
      and future tenses will forever affect how you perceive time and therefore
      how you perceive the rest of the world. Freaky, huh?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      An even more interesting example is writer Ayn Rand, who, in one of her
      books, made up a world in which the word “I” didn't exist. Can you imagine
      if you could never talk about yourself and say the word, “I”? What would
      that mean for your reality? What would that mean if you grew up never
      having that word in your vocabulary at all?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">So how does all of that relate?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-lg font-bold">
      Those who speak the online language, and those who don't.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Humans adapt, and quickly. And we have. In this sense, our worldview
      hasn't been limited by our language. Rather, our worldview is continually
      changed, challenged and adapted, thanks to technology. That said, if
      anything, our language has been limited by our worldview.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Who you are determines how you speak, what type of words you use, how you
      use them, and in which contexts. And for us, this is incredibly relevant
      as we attempt to bridge the gap between who your customers are, what
      language they speak, what type of words they use, how they use them, and
      in which contexts—so we can position you as the only person who really
      GETS THEM.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      This is a worthwhile goal. Humans tribe together, and you need to give
      them the right cues and signals to help them understand which tribe you
      (and what you're selling) represent.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-lg text-3xl text-center px-32">
      No matter what you're selling, if it helps them feel more like them, and
      helps them feel like they belong in the tribe they've self-identified
      with, they will want it.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      And in this way, our goal is to use language not just for the sake of
      communicating, but as a powerful creative selling tool to help us reach
      our goals. We can bend language to our will, and use it to influence
      thought.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      That said, trying to change a person's worldview is a fool's task.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      This is also why I advise students and clients to stop trying to convince
      and persuade people who don't share a similar worldview to buy their
      stuff.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      You know the people you're trying so hard to convince that yoga is the
      answer to everything? It's an idiot's errand. You're wasting your time.
      Rather, what we want to do is align ourselves with folks who
      <span class="italic">already</span> share a similar worldview, and then
      use language to demonstrate how what we're selling supports that worldview
      in ways they may not have considered prior.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Begin examining the type of language your customer's existing worldview
      does support, and then start using it to your advantage and weaving it
      into your message - instead of constantly going against the grain and
      trying to show them a different way.

      Some insight on this from the one and only Seth Godin:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-small px-32">
      “The worldview of a 45 year old wine-loving investment banker is very
      different from that of a fraternity brother. One might see a $100 bottle
      of burgundy as both a bargain and a must-have, while the other might see
      the very same bottle of wine as an insane waste of money.<br /><br />Worldview
      changes three things: attention, bias and vernacular. Attention, because
      we choose to pay attention to those things that we've decided matter.
      Bias, because our worldview alters the way we filter and interpret what we
      hear. And vernacular, because words and images resonate with people
      differently based on their worldview.”
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      It's extremely expensive, time consuming and difficult to change someone's
      worldview. The guys at Opus One shouldn't spend a lot of time marketing
      expensive wine to fraternities because it's not efficient. Sell nuts to
      squirrels, don't try to persuade dolphins that nuts are delicious.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So how do you predict someone's worldview in order to align your language
      with it? (The hard part, right?)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">And to that point: Let's first consider yours.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because your worldview is likely inextricably linked to whatever you're
      selling, and why you're selling it, and therefore, it follows that those
      reasons will also influence why the person who's going to buy it, will buy
      it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-lg text-3xl text-center px-32">
      Because in every way, shape, and form, what you're selling is a
      manifestation of your worldview.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      (I just used the word “manifestation,” but it had to be done.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Sit down with a giant saucer of hot tea, cozy up under the covers with a
      Moleskin, and talk out the following big picture questions. They won't
      only help you understand the story behind your product, (and thus, your
      message, and by extension, a very telling piece of your worldview), but
      it'll help you clearly discover the motivations behind your customers -
      the people you may never have met, but can still intimately know. And
      that's because on every level, we're all still human, and as such, when we
      can imagine how they feel, we can also predict their behavior.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">The key here is FEELING.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">Selling always goes back to feelings.</p>
