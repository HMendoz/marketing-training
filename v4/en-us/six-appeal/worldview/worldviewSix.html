      No matter what, you will always represent something
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      I know it's a lot to think about, but if you get stuck,
      <span class="italic">go hunt your customer down online</span>. Read what
      they're writing. What are they saying on blogs, on forums, in reviews?
      Learn to read between the lines. Consider these questions when you're
      analyzing your customers' perspectives, and look at their language through
      the lens of this thought process.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-lg text-3xl text-center px-32">
      What type of worldview would a person have to have to make X statement? To
      feel a certai way? To say a certain thing?
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">GET CURIOUS.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Play detective and get curious about who they are. Again, who they are is
      what you're selling them on. Even if it takes the form of something else,
      like a product or a service.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      If you're thinking this is difficult because your customers will have
      different worldviews, then you don't have a strong enough brand.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because your brand needs to stand for something. YOUR brand needs to have
      a worldview. This is non-negotiable.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If your job is to attract people to your brand, then you need to
      <span class="italic">give them something to be attracted to.</span> If you
      don't know what your brand represents, then you can't possibly attract
      anyone. This isn't about you. It's about what you want your BUSINESS to
      represent.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because no matter how you try to avoid it,
      <span class="underline">your business will represent something.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Your business is a living, breathing thing. And it's got a worldview of
      its own. So in order to make friends, you need to seek out people who have
      similar world views, right?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-3xl text-center px-32">
      Research reveals that consumers percieve the same type of personality
      characteristics in brands as they do in other people.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And just like with people, they are attracted more to some personality
      types than others – attractions that are emotion-based, not rational.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's all about relevancy – if what you offer and how you present it
      matches their worldview, and state of mind, you gain a customer. If your
      customer is “everybody”, you're making it extremely difficult for
      yourself. After all, nobody will identify with “everybody”.

      From friend and colleague, author Bernadette Jiwa:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-small px-32">
      The middle-aged couple at the garden centre stood with furrowed brows as
      the sales assistant explained the difference between the varieties of
      lemon tree. They took a step back and almost looked alarmed when he
      explained how one particular variety would bear a lot of fruit, but could
      become tall, straggly and unmanageable. Huge smiles of relief spread
      across their faces when he finally led them to a tree that would give them
      less fruit, but only grow to about a metre tall.<br /><br />There's a
      difference it seems between the idea of having home-grown lemons and
      actually growing them. <br /><br />Why go to the trouble of growing lemons
      at all, when fresh organic lemons sell for $15 a kilo and imported lemons
      from the USA cost half that? Why not just buy a bottle of lemon juice in
      the supermarket for $2? <br /><br />It turns out that there's more than
      one worldview about the value of a lemon and there's more than one way to
      sell a lemon too. Your customers have already bought into the story before
      they set foot in the store. It pays to know which worldview you're
      targeting.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Make selling a matter of finding each other. Like a love story.
