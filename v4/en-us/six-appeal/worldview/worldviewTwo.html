      Whatever you think you're selling, you're probably not
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      I'll be blunt: Whatever you think you're selling, you're probably not.
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold mt-10 mb-10 text-lg text-center">
      You're not selling your product, or service, or even yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      For a moment, let's imagine you're a therapist, and let's imagine you've
      found yourself leading group therapy with a child, a doctor, an ex-con,
      and a housewife. You've got one hour to say something life-changing. Would
      you ever be able to lead a therapy session that hit home for all of them?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The child might need to focus on the divorce of his parents, the doctor
      might need to focus on learning how to de-stress, the ex-con might need to
      focus on anger issues, and the housewife might need to find herself again.
      You'd have no choice but to see them 1:1 to have any hope of helping any
      of them.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      When you market your business, I want you to think of yourself as the
      therapist. You simply cannot go around addressing everyone. In an attempt
      to “cast your net” and help as many people as possible, what you end up
      doing is severely watering down your message, your resonating power, and
      your six appeal.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So, I want you to think about what you're selling with whatever it is
      you're attempting to write.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      Is it a book? Is it a service? Is it hand-me-down clothing?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      When writing a landing page for an email marketing intelligence agency,
      the norm for them would have been a movie trailer that went something
      like,
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I want you to cast aside the idea that you'll sell it to whoever is
      willing to pay you for it. (That's prostitution, you guys, not marketing.)
      And rather, contemplate who the BEST match would be for your thing.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Who would fall obsessively in love with it? Who would be the #1 fan of
      this thing? Who wouldn't be able to shut up about it to their friends,
      neighbors, and their 800 Facebook friends?
      <span class="font-bold">Who is that person?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      What do they act like? Sound like? Look like? Work like? Walk like? And
      most importantly, in your best case scenario, what do they say about the
      thing you're selling? What do they say about YOU?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Now, imagine yourself as the therapist again, in a room with four of those
      same people. You've got an hour to say something life-changing. Is it
      easier to figure out than when you were sitting in front of the child, the
      doctor, the ex-con and the housewife? You bet it is. Because now you've
      got focus. Now you've got your eye on the ball, and you know where to
      swing. Now, you can craft a message that's tailor-made for THEM. So the
      minute they stumble upon your message, they'll know, instantly, that you
      were put on earth for them to find you. Or at least that's how we want to
      make them feel, anyway.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's really hard to do that when you're targeting everybody, isn't it? As
      you may have heard before, when you target everybody, you target nobody.
      And this couldn't be more true.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I want to challenge you to FOCUS. Focus on one segment of your market, if
      you have to. Get really specific. Practice with it. And see where it leads
      you. In terms of your ideas, in terms of your creativity, and certainly in
      terms of your message—which is why we're here in the first place.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The most important piece of what you're selling
      <span class="italic">is who you're selling it to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="text-3xl font-bold italic mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32">
      And that means that who you're selling to
      <span class="underline"
        >is just as much of your product as what you're actually selling.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      And if that's the case? Then we really need to know a lot more about who
      we're selling it to. Because if they're a part of our product? Then we
      need to know about it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      Because you can't sell something you do not understand.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Furthermore, people
      <span class="italic">won't buy something they</span> don't understand.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Put the two together and you're doomed.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      At the end of the day, when we talk about creating six appeal with your
      lenguage, your words, your message and your positioning, remember one
      thing:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      You aren't selling a product, a service, or even yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">You're selling your customer?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 font-bold text-lg">...on themselves.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Now, how do we get this big fucking fancy understanding of who we're
      <span class="italic">really</span> selling to? How do we get into bed with
      them?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Let me guess: Maybe you read a marketing book once, and as a result, you
      now have a “customer avatar” jammed in the third drawer of your desk,
      getting sumo-wrestled by the stapler, and more crinkled than your good
      Sunday pants. (You do have good Sunday pants, don't you? For 4-wheeling?)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If you don't have a customer avatar, let me explain two things:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">First, I'm not going to make you one.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And second, it's a concept in marketing that asks you to imagine your
      target customer and bring them to life, often drawing them on a piece of
      paper, giving them a name, and perhaps even hanging it above your desk.
      Then the concept is that anytime you aren't sure what to do in marketing
      or in business as a whole, you look at your customer avatar and think of
      Little Susie - and then make decisions based on what she would want.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Not, there's a lot to be said about the value in customer avatars - I'm
      not knockin' 'em. They're useful, particularly of you're a fantastic
      artist. :)
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6 font-bold">
      But I also take issue with them, and here's w hy:
    </p>
    <div class="mt-10 text-lg">
      <ol>
        <li>
          As mentiones before, if you do have one of these customer avatars,
          it's probably shoved under your bed and you haven't thought about it
          in months. (Years?)
          <p class="italic mt-5 text-lg">
            What's that? You jotted down your tax payment confirmation on Little
            Susie's right nostril?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-6">
          Most customer avatar exercises lead you into surface-level thinking,
          because they're guided first by superficial demographic information,
          (age, sex, appearance, income, level, education), and then maybe if we
          we're lucky, a few superficial psychographics, (like rock music,
          rebels against mom, is sentitive about her weight).
          <p class="mt-5 text-lg">And the biggest problem with all of that?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl font-bold italic px-32">
      Superficial thinking will lead you to write superficial copy. And
      superficial isn't selling anyone.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Unless you're selling preschool enrollment or a retirement condo in Miami,
      age is fas less relevant than mentality.
    </p>
    <div class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The reason why they're going to buy something from you, and not the next
      gut, has nothing to do with the fact they're 46.5 years old, and
      everything to do with
      <span class="italic">what they think about</span> the fact they're 46.5
      years old.
    </div>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The reason why they're going to buy something from you, and not the next
      guy, is not because “they have blank apartment walls,” and everything to
      do with what they think they should be on those walls.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The reason why they're going to buy something from you, and not the next
      guy, is not because, “they're having marital problems and need a shrink,”
      and everything to do with
      <span class="italic">
        what kind of shrink they think will understand them the most.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      What's the key phrase here that keeps being repeated over and over and
      over again?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 font-bold text-lg text-center">What they think.</p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Because, hallelujah, people have thoughts. The people you're trying to
      sell to have thoughts. They have thoughts about the world, they have
      thoughts about themselves, and they certainly have thoughts about what it
      is you're selling. And guess what those thoughts are called?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 font-bold text-lg text-center">Their worldview.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      <span class="italic">Worldview.</span> That's the name of this game,
      <span class="underline">
        because this is going to underline every single thing you do from here
        on out.
      </span>
      Understand a person's worldview, and you'll be able to position yourself
      in line with their worldview. And since our job is to sell our reader on
      themselves? Then this is precisely where
      <span class="italic">themselves</span>…starts.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And THAT is what The Six Appeal Process is all about
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Just like the therapist would find it difficult to give an on-point
      session to four dramatically different characters, you will find it
      difficult to craft the perfect hook that's going to appeal to four
      dramatically different characters.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And that's why you're going to stop trying to appeal to dramatically
      different characters, and just focus on one.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Except we aren't going to focus on one character. We're going to focus on
      one worldview.
