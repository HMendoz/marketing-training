      Using worldview to find each other
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So this worldview stuff is <span class="italic">important</span>. (By
      which i mean no skipping, fast-forwarding, glossing over, or ignoring.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's the foundation of your customer's every belief, and in turn, how
      they'll feel about what you say to them, and in which ways.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">And with that comes this truth:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-lg font-bold text-3xl text-center px-32">
      You cannot successfully sell anything, when, in the process, you
      accidentally violate someone's sense of IDENTITY.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      You've got to <span class="italic">support</span> their identity.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Studies show that people will actually avoid buying something that
      conflicts with their identity. And that makes sense when you think about
      it, right?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Surprise! I didn't. She naturally assumed I was buying Fiji water as a
      commodity, and that all water was the same, with a mere difference in
      price. Yet, I naturally assumed she knew the real reason I was buying the
      Fiji water: Because it makes a statement about who we are, and what's
      important to us. I buy Fiji water for the simple reason that the packaging
      makes me feel gorgeous, as if it were an extension of my own personal
      style, and that, for me, makes the experience of drinking the water more
      enjoyable. And that has nothing to do with the water itself, and
      everything to do with
      <span class="italic">how the damn water makes me feel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The stupid package is an extension of my personal style, which says
      something about me: Personal style must be important. And if personal
      style is important, what might that say about my worldview? Well, a few
      things:
    </p>
    <ol class="mt-6 text-lg" type="1">
      <li>I value individuality.</li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        Appearance isn't superficial, but animportant extension of who I am.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">How I look is who I am.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And if that's the case, then it means that the person in charge of
      advertising Fiji water, or writing copy for the Fiji label, shouldn't
      write something about how good the water
      <span class="italic">tastes.</span> (A feature.) They shouldn't write
      something about <span class="italic">the quality</span> of the water.
      (Again, a feature.) Nor should they mention what a good bargain it is, or
      how it's a “good deal.” Rather, they need to write something that's going
      to help me view their water
      <span class="italic">as an extension of me and my worldview.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Therefore, instead of writing something like:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-lg italic text-center">
      Fiji Water<br />The world's cleanest, most refreshing H2O.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">I might write something like:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-lg italic text-center">
      Fiji Water<br />NEVER HIDE.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And this is what we mean by an emotional HOOK statement. We're writing our
      emotional hook statements to serve as the foundation of our message - to
      grab the heart strings of the people we want to attract. Only then, once
      we've got a strong emotional hook statement, do we begin to flesh out the
      rest of our message-the details, the must-knows, the extras.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-lg font-bold text-3xl text-center px-32">
      We all want brands to inspire us and express our values so well that being
      a customer becomes a source of pride and joy for us.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Once you've got a hypotesis about your customer's worldview, and hoe it
      intersects with what you sell, you work to craft a hook statement that
      will appeal to that worldview-
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 italic text-small">
      -even if you never say a word about your product.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      You certainly don't have to go that route, though—you
      <span class="italic">can</span> talk about your product. You just need to
      make sure you're doing it in a way that aligns with the right worldview
      you're going for.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">Imagine I'm a wedding photographer</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I don't want to appeal to every bride on the planet, because first of all,
      it's impossible, and secondly, you certainly must have personal
      preferences, right? Your personal preferences likely line up with your own
      worldview, and hence, the worldview of your business. So we want to make
      sure we get a match.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So let's say I'm this wedding photographer, and I don't want to appeal to
      the traditional bride who's dreamed of this day since she was a little
      girl. Maybe I like working with brides who are less traditional. Maybe
      even skeptical of the whole wedding thing. Maybe they're more fun that
      way—they allow me to get creative with my photography, and these are the
      weddings I enjoy most.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      So first thing's first: I consider my customer's worldview.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Her worldview is likely that she isn't the “marrying type” and is
      skeptical of the whole ordeal—but let's say her mother-in-law wanted her
      first-born son to have a “traditional wedding”...so here the bride is,
      gagging herself through it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 tgext-lg">
      Now, that's a considerably different worldview from the girl who's been
      dreaming about the perfect dress since she was ten. And as such, we need
      to adjust our hook statements to really speak to the right person we want
      to attract. So instead of saying something expected, (like you'd see in
      your average movie trailer—which is why I had you do that exercise, so you
      could first consider what's expected), instead, you might write something
      like:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-center text-small px-32">
      The kiss could be awkward.<br />Your girls might fall out.<br />There's
      always a chance of rain.<br />And nothing's stopping Uncle Harry from
      dirty dancing with your college roommate.<br /><br /><span
        class="font-bold"
        >Good thing we're pros at this.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Do you see how statements like this are FAR more powerful in regards to
      appealing to the person you want to be working with, rather than some
      generic blanket statement about once-in-a-lifetime memories and the big
      walk down the aisle?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Allow yourself to really get in the head of the people you're selling to,
      <span class="underline"
        >and use their thoughts to guide your language.</span
      >
      (More on this to come.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I promise this will get easier as you learn to adopt the right mindset
      when you write to sell.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-lg font-bold text-3xl text-center px-32">
      For now, don't worry so much about picking the perfect word; worry more
      about picking the perfect message.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">The perfect words will come later.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Eighty percent of the writing process is editing, and therefore brilliant
      writing isn't a writing process at all.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg italic">It's an editing process.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And we're going to edit our way to sales, one step at a time.
