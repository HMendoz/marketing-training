      The worldview of your customer
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      A worldview includes themes, values, emotions, and ethics, part of which
      comes from your culture, part from your upbringing, and part from your
      past experiences. It's an all-encompassing perspective on
      <span class="italic">everything</span> that exists and matters to you
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      In other words, it's a pretty big deal. And it's way more important when
      it comes to selling than you ever thought.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Your worldview shapes and informs EVERY SINGLE EXPERIENCE YOU'VE EVER HAD.
      (And ever will have.) You know that whole rose-colored glasses saying?
      Alright, now imagine them being hot chartreuse glasses, and now imagine
      you wearing them all the time, day and night. The glasses affect what you
      see, and how you see it. (Is your mailman hot...chartreuse?) And depending
      on the degree of transparency of the lens, you might see some things more
      easily, while other things are de-emphasized, distorted, or in some cases,
      not even visible at all.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Our behavior is driven by our deepest desires, values and motivations -
      <span class="italic">all</span> of which are directed by our worldviews.
      And that includes our buying behavior.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And that's why worldview is so imperative for you to understand—much more
      than demographics or basic psychographics or superficial customer avatars.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-lg font-bold text-3xl text-center px-32">
      Because you have no choice but to adjust the frame of your message
      depending on which color glasses your buyer is wearing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Now here's the tricky thing about worldview: A person's beliefs can't, by
      definition, be proven in the logical sense, because they're considered an
      axiom. That's to say, the starting point for anyone's reasoning is already
      biased because it's coming from <span class="italic">within</span> their
      own worldview - and therefore their beliefs are typically argued
      <span class="italic">from</span> rather than argued
      <span class="italic">for</span>. (Read that sentence twice. It's a doozy.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Most people are pretty oblivious to the specific worldviews they've
      absorbed, (who knows what growing up in Scranton did to me), but that
      doesn't mean they're any less relevant. Just because your customer doesn't
      recognize their own worldviews does not mean they don't exist.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Your customer's worldview underlines every belief, value, and every action
      they'll take until the day they die. That's why many people live or think
      in a certain way, without knowing or even considering the worldview from
      which their belief or behavior derives.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      That said, the idea isn't for us to try and explicitly point out someone's
      worldview with our words. Rather, what we need to do is sit down and take
      a thorough inventory of what color glasses our buyer might be wearing, and
      what kinds of beliefs and values might be held by wearing those particular
      glasses. And then, furthermore, how those beliefs might impact how they
      view what we're selling—and, ultimately,
      <span class="underline"
        >what we need to say to align our product with their worldview..</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If we can put the same colored glasses on, then we don't only better
      understand what they're seeing, but we can write the words they need to
      hear - not just any old ones that come to mind. (Which is usually the
      strategy, right? “They'll get the point,” you think to yourself. But
      getting the point is not the point. Making them want you is.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Essentially, The Six Appeal Process is a "pattern-matching" process. And
      our main goal is to align the pattern of your words with the pattern of
      their worldview in creative, delightfully surprising new ways that stop
      them dead in their tracks, and makes them never have to think twice about
      saying YES.
