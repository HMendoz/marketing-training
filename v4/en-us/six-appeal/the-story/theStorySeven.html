      Writing isn't the result
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Now it's time to get more into the specifics. The nitty gritty of the
      actual writing, if you will. How can make sense of things like worldviews,
      and bring them down to earth in a practical, applicable way?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I can't give you a sentence-by-sentence formula, because formulas don't
      account for complexities, for uniqueness, and most importantly, for
      capitalizing on quirks. (Quite possibly your best selling point!) The Six
      Appeal Process is about taking anything you're writing, and helping you
      lovingly lace it with pieces of emotionally charged language that gets
      people excited, gets people hooked,
      <span class="underline">and gets people wanting you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And that means that it needs to be applicable to anything you're writing
      as well. And that's the goal. To give you the gorgeous gift of brilliant
      writing - even when you don't consider yourself a brilliant writer - in
      order to help you get the things that you want in life.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      Is it more sales? More clients? More conversions? More money?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Do you want to use it to get into culinary school, or send a plea letter
      to Congress, or write your children a meaningful love letter?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Do you want to write the pitch letter that'll forever change your life?
      Write the blog post of the year? Get featured in Oprah magazine?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Writing a book? Asking people for their vote? Writing the product labels
      for your brand new wine collection? (I definitely need a wine collection.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Or maybe you just want whoever reads your diary, long after you're gone,
      to love every single word. ;)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      No matter what you're writing, one thing is always the same: Its a human
      who's reading it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And therefore, by studying human nature, and worldview, and how the people
      you're writing for think about things, you're learning far more about
      writing than it seems. Writing is not a writing process; it's an editing
      process, which is really a thinking process. A process in which you and I
      take these little symbols that we, as humans, all memorized, arrange them
      into these little strings called words that everybody understands, and
      then figure out how to optimize those arrangements so our words
      <span class="underline">mean something to the right people.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's almost like planting a code. When done correctly, the right people
      will know exactly what you mean.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And that's the key right there: We don't just want people to understand
      what we're saying.
      <span class="underline"
        >We want what we're saying to mean something to them.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 italic text-3xl">
      There's a difference between understanding and meaning.When there's an
      understanding, you've processed something in your breain. But when there's
      meaning? You've processed it in your heart.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Average writing is writing that other people understand.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Sixy writing is writing that other people
      <span class="italic">feel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Not everybody feels the same about the same things, though. And that's why
      the first few lessons were so important—to carefully consider the mindset
      of the person you're talking to. To understand not just their thoughts,
      but where those thoughts come from. (Worldview.) Because only then can we
      delicately arrange words in a way that will, for all intents and purposes,
      <span class="underline">become the code.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And I think this is really where the rubber meets the road. Most people
      are trying to write in a way that “everybody understands.” They're trying
      to remove any barriers to communication, and write for a general audience.
      They're trying to remove the code.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      But what they fail to realize is that
      <span class="italic">the code is where meaning is found</span>. The code
      is what signals to the right people that they've found their tribe. The
      code is what cues people that it's okay to trust you, that you're one of
      them, that you know what they want, and that you can deliver.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">The code is the key.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And that's precisely what we're here to learn with The Six Appeal Process:
      How to take generic words that anyone will understand, and turn them into
      words the right people will <span class="italic">feel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because just like trying to sell to "anyone" is an ineffective marketing
      plan, trying to write for "anyone" is, too.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">The best writers are the best thinkers.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Writing is a thinking process, where, contrary to popular belief, writing
      isn't the result.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">Meaning is</p>
