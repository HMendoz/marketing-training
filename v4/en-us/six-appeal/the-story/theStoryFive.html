      An emotional toehold
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So how do we foster that emotional toehold with words?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      How do we use words to tell the right mini-stories that get those mirror
      neurons firing?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Let's start by going back to our primary goal:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center italic text-3xl px-32">
      to make your story their story.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So we're tasked with making our story feel like their story. And
      furthermore, we're tasked with verbalizing their story even if they didn't
      recognize it as their story. And last but not least, if they did recognize
      it as their story, they might not have been able to verbalize it.

    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Neuroscience shows that synapses occur inside the brain when we've made a
      connection among various different things. And furthermore, the more
      random the components connected, the more synapses occur.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      As this fascinating experiment by Google eloquently explains:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 italic text-sm">
      “Synapses are the basis of creativity. In other words, synapses firing =
      creative joy. As kids, that happens all the time because everything is
      new. Everything is foreign. They aren't constrained by the rules about
      what “goes together.” Why else was putting the Barbie in the toy car wash
      more fun than putting the car in the car wash? The web frees us to return
      to this child-like state where we can adventure through a whole array of
      different, seemingly unrelated, images and clips – be they old, new, from
      a world away or own backyard – sparking our all important synapses and
      helping us come up with new combinations and ideas so easily.”
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      So, when you can return people to a childlike state and help them see
      things through a fresh lens they never considered, or see themselves in a
      way they never considered, or help them see your industry in a way they'd
      never considered, and/or help them see what you're selling in a way they'd
      never considered, you spark a whole bunch of exciting brain synapses that
      will accomplish a few things:
    </p>
    <ol class="mt-20 mb-20 px-32 text-sm" type="1">
      <li>Excite their imagination</li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        Make them pay attention. (Remember when we talked about the brain and
        how, when it reads something it didn't expect, it pays more attention
        because to the brain surprise means it didn't know something?)
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        Associate you and your brand with this gorgeous new fascination.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        Project the feeling of freshness, discovery, excitement and intrigue
        onto you - helping you seem different in a sea of sameness, and helping
        you get the leg up that you NEED.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-lg">
      In other words, as the experiment by Google will confirm:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      "Humans aren't necessarily attracted to the allure of the new, as much as
      we like to see things we're already familar with in a new way."
