      Mirror neurons and storytelling
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Many people commented back on the Facebook post, saying it made them tear
      up. Others wrote that it made them want to call their mom. And ALL
      responded with a feeling. So let's unpack this. What is it about this
      little Facebook post that has the ability to pack such an emotional punch?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      There are a number of reasons this little paragraph was able to hit an
      emotional high note, but first we're going to start with the biggest
      reason of all, the foundation of everything:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 italic text-sm">Story.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I have a love/hate relationship with this word. On one hand, it's overused
      and misunderstood. You hear people talking about storytelling all the time
      these days.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm italic text-center">
      "Brand storytelling"<br />"Authentic storytelling"<br />"The power of
      story."
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      And it kind of makes you roll your eyes a little bit, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">But do you know why that is?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because no one's effectively helping you understand
      <span class="underline">what they mean by that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Tell me that you'll help me craft my “brand story,” and it sounds like you
      want to make me a mission statement. Translation: Not on the top of my
      to-do list if I'm a busy, harried, hustling entrepreneur. Do people even
      read mission statements anymore?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Yet, that's not what they mean at all, and story IS important. Paramount,
      in fact. Because telling a story helps you naturally connect the dots &
      strategically call out your target audience, align with their worldview,
      speak to their perceptions on your industry and what you're selling
      because of that worldview, and—here's the kicker—
      <span class="italic"
        >do so in a way that's interesting and engaging for them</span
      >
      to read. Because that's number one, right?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      You might have an interesting message, but if it isn't interesting and/or
      engaging <span class="underline">to read</span>,
      <span class="italic">it won't get read.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      But here's the caveat (and the really, really important piece of the
      puzzle that most people— even the ones talking about “brand stories”—do
      not necessarily understand):.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      We are not talking about telling stories in the same way that most people
      think of the word "story".
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      This is where a lot of the confusion comes in. We aren't talking about
      writing a little essay with a beginning, middle and end. We aren't talking
      about telling a little bed time story to your customer. How do you put
      that shit on your services page, right?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Rather, we're talking about telling a story
      <span class="underline">through every single sentence you write.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Whether it's the sentences that make up that services page, your bio,
      product descriptions, a love letter to your customers, a book jacket, a
      book, or something else.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">We have one goal, and one goal only:</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-3xl italic text-center px-32">
      To make your story their story.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      And to do so by selecting just the right words that will make them feel
      like, “Yes. <span class="italic">This</span> is what I'm about.”
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      ...Even if they didn't know it. And
      <span class="italic">especially</span> if they couldn't verbalize it
      prior. (This is one of your greatest secret weapons, so file that idea
      away for safe keeping.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because even if you aren't talking about them directly, you should be
      choosing words that are, in one way or another,
      <span class="underline">about them</span>. Words that make them feel like
      they were hand-selected for th
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 font-bold text-lg">Have you ever heard of mirror neurons?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's what's working behind the scenes in your brain when you see someone
      stub their toe on a big, fat rock and you instinctively flinch. Or if you
      witness a car rear-end another car. (Ouch.) Or even when someone smiles at
      you and you have the instinct to smile back. (Unless they're your
      significant other and you're angry - then it's poker face to the death.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-sm text-center px-32">
      “Before the discovery of mirror neurons, scientists generally believed
      that our brains used logical thought processes to interpret and predict
      other people's actions. Now, however, many have come to believe that we
      understand others not by thinking, but by feeling. For mirror neurons
      appear to let us "simulate" not just other people's actions, but the
      intentions and emotions behind those actions.”
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Some of the most important research around mirror neurons is how it helps
      us develop empathy for others. Empathy isn't something we have to think
      about to produce; it just happens. We feel something based on what we see
      other people feeling.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And do you know why this will change your writing forever?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because it turns out that, even when just listening to a speaker tell a
      story, the same exact areas of both the speaker and the listener's brains
      light up in an fMRI - even though one person was telling the story, and
      the rest of the people were merely listening to it. (According to this
      study by Princeton.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And even more freakily? Theories of neuroscience show that if your mirror
      neurons are exposed long enough to another person's ideas over any period
      of time, they
      <span class="italic">actually adapt and change themselves</span>—and this
      is how learning and growth occurs. (And also why you pick up the habits of
      your friends.) Because your brain rewires itself. “Cells that fire
      together, wire together,” as it were.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">The part we're really interested in, however?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      Is how we can make this happen via the written word.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because it <span class="italic">does</span> happen via the written word.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's why just reading about scraping fingernails down a chalkboard makes
      you cringe.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Pick the right words, and the reader will feel them - just as if they were
      experiencing them. And it's the feeling that we're after. Because that
      feeling is called <span class="italic">emotion</span>. And as we talked
      about in the beginning, emotions are felt far sooner than any thought or
      logical response, and are much more responsible for the decisions that
      your reader is making.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">It's about getting an emotional toehold</p>
