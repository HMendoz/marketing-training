      #1-3 of emotionally-charged writing
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Let's return to the Facebook post and talk about some of the things that
      turned an every day tribute into a piece of emotionally charged writing.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      As many of you guessed in the exercise that followed, there are several
      factors that went into making that Facebook post something that most would
      consider emotionally compelling. So much so, in fact, that many of the
      commenters claimed it brought tears to their eyes. When you can create a
      physical emotional response, you know you've hit the jackpot. And you
      don't even have to go to the casino, you guys. :)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      That said, let's begin by reviewing it once again. Afterward, I'll go over
      the exact elements that went into creating this effect. Then, I'll guide
      you through a process for how you can implement these elements into your
      own writing, so by the end of this class, your words won't be words;
      they'll be emotional heartstrings. And all that'll be left to do?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">Is tug</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">The post, round two:</p>
    <div class="text-sm px-32 text-center italic mt-20 mb-20">
      Today would have been her 70th birthday. I'm wearing her gold aquamarine
      ring.<br /><br />i'm wearing it to remember to be gentle, to slow down,
      and to offer every stranger who ever sets foot in your house the biggest
      Italian bread sandwich known to man.<br /><br />To garden always (or at
      least try), to worship tomatoes, and to write fancy sick notes for my
      future children (complete with pressed flowers and calligraphy pens).<br /><br />To
      see the best in the cranky gas station attendant, to look them in the eye
      and see their human, to wear black and white as a religion, to sip water
      from fancy red brandy glasses, and to treat yourself even when you don't
      feel like you deserve it. (You do.)<br /><br />To read more crime
      mysteries, to use paperbacks as a drug, put whip cream in your coffee, and
      to indulge in quiet time like other people indulge in happy hour.<br /><br />To
      sign your name with gorgeous intention (in particular when there are
      people in line behind you at the grocery store), to lovingly obsess over
      the details, to always let people have their moment, and to be classy-even
      when you're angry.<br /><br />To pick a husband who will put you on a
      pedestal, to remember never to take him for granted, to love without
      judging, and to try not to judge much at all, period. (You never know
      someone's story.)<br /><br />And most importantly, to put a wildly
      beautiful stamp on everything you do, and to live, live, live, not as much
      as you can afford, but as much as you can feel. Because as long as you
      feel something, the rest are just details.<br /><br />Love you, mom. A lot
      of people tell me that you'd be proud of me. But what they don't know is
      that everything I've accomplished has nothing to do with me, and
      everything to do with the way I was raised.<br /><br />And that being the
      case?<br /><br />I'm just as proud of you.<br /><br />Happy 70th birthday.
    </div>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">Element #1: Look! It's a hook!</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Surprise! Turns out I wasn't making you write all of those hooks for
      nothing, after all. The first sentence of this Facebook post is, believe
      it or not, a hook disguised as an innocent little sentence. See? You can't
      escape the hook. Not even if you try and beg and whine and scream and kick
      and yell.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm italic text-center px-32">
      Today would have been her 70th birthday. I'm wearing her gold aquamarine
      ring.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">What makes it an effective hook?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">The curiosity gap.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      In other words, I don't give it up on the first date. Why buy the cow when
      you can get the milk for free, right? That's to say,
      <span class="italic"
        >why keep reading if I already know what this is going to be
        about?</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      For example, I could have easily said, “Today would have been my mom's
      70th birthday,” but I didn't, because that would have gave away the farm.
      (Let's see how many Old McDonald metaphors can I stick in here.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      You don't want to give people all the information they need to decide if
      they want to read more or not, because most often, they'll decide they
      don't—especially if they think something is about your mother. :) And then
      you're cutting yourself off at the pass.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If your goal is to get them to read the next sentence, you've got to lure
      them there.
      <span class="underline"
        >You can't give them all the information they need.</span
      >
      It's against the law of human nature. What you really need to do is
      pretend your hook sentences are the equivalent of Angelina Jolie batting
      her eyes at your reader right before she disappears around the corner. Who
      wouldn't follow that?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Contrary to what you learned in school, right?
      <span class="italic"
        >Make a thesis statement! State your argument! Be clear! Don't use
        ambiguous language!</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">You know what I have to say about that?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Flush-a-roo! Down the toilet. Don't forget to wash your hands on the way
      out.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Why? Because they forgot to tell you they were talking about
      <span class="italic">academic writing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And, last I checked, people do not hang on the edge of their seats waiting
      around to read your term paper. So unless you're writing your graduate
      thesis on the sperm whale, you need to exile all of that “common sense”
      from your brain. It has no place in real writing that real people read.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And if you're wondering if it's really possible that one small
      substitution from “her” to “my mom's” could render a hook statement less
      effective? You can stop wondering, because I'm telling you that absolutely
      it can—and WILL.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      No matter what you're writing, I always want you to consider the first
      sentence of everything as the hook—including the first sentence of every
      single paragraph—and I want you to deliberately craft it as such, too.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Does it take time? Yes. Does it take thought? A lot. Is it sometimes
      difficult? Absolutely. Does that mean you should skip it? Never.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Writing is a thinking process, where, contrary to popular belief, writing
      isn't the result.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      <span class="italic">Never</span> take human curiosity for granted.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 text-lg font-bold">Element #2: It's Hyper Specific.</p>
    <div class="text-sm px-32 text-center italic mt-20 mb-20">
      ...to offer every stranger who ever sets foot in your house the biggest
      Italian bread sandwich known to man.<br /><br />..and to write fancy sick
      notes for my future children (complete with pressed flowers and
      calligraphy pens)<br /><br />...to sip water from fancy red brandy
      glasses<br /><br />...to put whip cream in your coffee<br /><br />...to
      sign your name with gorgeous intention (in particular when there are
      people in line behind you at the grocery store)
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">Details. Very, very specific details.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And yet, most people, when they sit down to write something, do so with
      the intention to “make it relevant for everyone.” So they talk in general
      terms. They try not to alienate anyone. They try to make it applicable to
      anyone who “might be reading.” But that's precisely the point: You should
      know who you want reading. Do not fall into this trap. That's why we did
      all that stuff about worldview. Is this making sense now?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 italic text-3xl">
      Contrary to instinct, including hyper specific details does not alienate
      people from the experiencie; rather, it makes people feel more included.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      We feel <span class="italic">connected</span> through the details.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      It's as if you get to spy on a secret part of my life, my thoughts, my
      feelings, and feel them for yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Certainly I knew that not everyone's mother drank water out of a red
      brandy glass. But I included the detail because it paints a picture, and
      makes you feel like you're there. And the more you can make someone feel
      like they're a part of the experience, the more they'll feel. Remember
      mirror neurons?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Contrast that statement - “...to sip water from fancy red brandy glasses”
      - with - “She drank water from her favorite glass.”
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Contrast “...to offer every stranger who ever sets foot in your house the
      biggest Italian bread sandwich known to man” with “She was very generous
      to anyone who ever stopped by.”
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Contrast “...and to write fancy sick notes for my future children
      (complete with pressed flowers and calligraphy pens) with “She was a
      thoughtful human being.”
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">
      The more specifics you use, the more included people feel. Because while
      you're telling a specific story, you're really using that story to tell
      their story.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Highlighting the universal in the specific. It's an art form we'll be
      learning how to do effectively in the next few lessons! Not to mention -
      this type of writing is just more interesting to read, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And here's the even bigger benefit. Ever heard the writing advice to
      “show, don't tell?” It's great advice. And this is one way that's
      accomplished. Through specifics. When you use specific details, you can
      paint a picture about a person without ever having to come out and
      directly say it. I could have said, “My mom would have been 70 today. She
      loved to garden, and every time I see a tomato I think of her. She was so
      thoughtful, always very generous with anyone who visited. I miss her, and
      I hope she'd proud.” But I think it's pretty obvious that writing falls
      flat. And the reason it falls flat is because you're telling me instead of
      showing me.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 text-lg font-bold">Element #3: Unexpected Word Pairings</p>
    <div class="text-sm px-32 text-center italic mt-20 mb-20">
      Gorgeous intention.<br />Worship tomatoes.<br />Fancy sick notes.<br />Livingly
      obsess.
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Oh how I love an unexpected juxtaposition of words. And so does every
      reader. Why? Because it surprises the brain. (And you know how much we're
      into that.) The brain sees one word and thinks it knows which ones is
      coming next, so when you throw that off kilter? It gets attention. Bonus?
      It feels FRESH. And when your writing feels fresh, you know what happens?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg"><span class="italic">You</span> feel fresh.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Remember how we talked about how people are fascinated by finding a fresh
      perspective on the familiar?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">That's why this works</p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center px-32 italic text-3xl">
      Always look for a new way to say something old. There's power in that.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg font-bold">
      Element #4: Reinforce Worldview & Sell Them on Themselves
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Now here's where things start getting interesting. Everything you write
      has to be selected with the utmost care. Every detail you include has to
      be selected with care. Because we want the details, and what those details
      mean, to line up with the worldview of the person we're writing for.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      I wrote that Facebook post for the TMFproject audience: An audience that
      appreciates an inspirational message, that loves to DIY, that values human
      connection (in particular in a world more and more dominated by an online
      connection), that wants to remember to slow down, who want this life to be
      a wildly memorable adventure. I hand-selected details about my mom to
      include that would support their worldview.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">I can't stress the importance of this.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Remember before when we talked about trying to reinforce your target
      market's identity? This is one way that you do that. You line up the
      details you emphasize with the ones that will resonate with their
      worldview, and help them reinforce their own decisions they make in life.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Consider the other details I could have included about my mom:
    </p>
    <ol class="mt-20 px-32 text-sm">
      <li>
        She thought everybody in the United States should learn English
        (something we held VERY different perspectives about)
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        She showed up with alcohol on her breath to meet my principal & Andrew
        McKelvey, the founder of Monster.com who was awarding me a full
        scholarship to college. The principal called me down after their meeting
        to express his concern.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        She relied on government assistance to survive, never once considering
        starting her own business.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        She was scared to death to drive in the snow, in the rain, and at night.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-lg">
      But instead of including those details, I left them out and painted a
      picture of her being a gentle homebody, a DIYer, someone who appreciated
      life and knew something the rest of us didn't.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      A member of our inaugural Six Appeal class noted this:
    </p>
    <div class="text-sm px-32 text-center italic mt-20 mb-20">
      “There's something else about this piece. Can't quite put my finger on it,
      but almost all the memories you share are the opposite of the normal,
      expected situations. They're all unconventional approaches to living.
      "Slow down," in a fast paced, non-stop world. "Be kind to strangers and
      give them a sandwich" when most people will barely look a stranger in the
      eye, much less smile at them. "Sign your name with gorgeous intention"
      when most everyone scribbles an indecipherable scrawl of chicken scratch
      when they sign their name, because they're in a hurry and no one will ever
      look at their signature on that credit card receipt anyway. Everything
      you're calling out to remember about what your mom taught you is
      unconventional and unexpected. It makes me feel inspired to stand up and
      just fucking be myself, despite the conventions of those around me.”
    </div>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Remember: You aren't using words to tell a story; you're using them to
      paint a picture. Make sure you know which picture you need to be painting.
      (Hint: It's the one that will help them see THEMSELVES in YOU.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 text-lg font-bold">Element #5: It's Says Something.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Yes I'm talking about my mom, but what am I really saying?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Make sure that no matter what you're talking about, the reader can always
      tease a universal theme or message from your words. We aren't writing for
      the hell of it; we're writing to communicate something. Check out the TMF
      blog and notice that all of the lifestyle related posts all carry a
      universal message about life - even if they're talking about something as
      silly as a date I went on.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Another inaugural member of Six Appeal noted:</p>
    <div class="text-sm px-32 text-center italic mt-20 mb-20">
      “Wearing the ring allows you to cruise through this list. This is a how to
      be a better person list. It is telling you to be kind, to slow down, to
      enjoy, how to treat others. There is contrast. How many life advice lists
      like this include a cranky gas attendant? This is love but done so
      differently. It is rich. Your story doesn't have a beginning, middle, end
      because it is a list. The items don't have to all connect to each other.
      The connection is that it all comes from your mom's good sense. You pack
      so much punch into each sentence that you can cover a lot in a small
      space, like a Facebook post. Like you tell us, every word counts.”
    </div>
    <p class="text-lg">
      The reason you want to make sure that your writing carries a message
      greater than the words on the page is not so you can play Mother Teresa,
      however.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The real reason is this: Because if they like the message, they'll like
      you.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">It's simple</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Have you ever found yourself wanting to buy something you totally didn't
      need-and maybe never will need-only because you loved the message of the
      company?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Yup.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      What you say really is more important than you sell. And people buy things
      not because they need them (never because they need them),
      <span class="underline"
        >but because of what buying those things says about them as
        people.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">We all wanto to be seen</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Weave a message through your writing that helps feel like you SEE them?
      And they'll not only be on board, but they'll share it with everyone they
      know.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because deep down inside, we all want to make a statement about who we
      are.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And we use products, services and things to illustrate just that:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">Our identity.</p>
    <p class="mt-20 text-lg font-bold">
      Element #6: It ends just like it begins: With a bang.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      We already talked (a lot) about the hook, but the beginning isn't the only
      important piece; <span class="italic">the end is just as important.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      While the beginning compels people to read more, the end is equally
      powerful because, believe it or not, it's what people remember most. And
      it's the end that's going to make or break it for them. It's the end
      that's going to determine if they think, “Yeah!” or “Meh.”
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Think about that time you spent two hours watching a great movie, and then
      the ending is limp. What a disappointment, right? No matter how great the
      movie itself was, if it has a bad ending, it makes you feel like the whole
      movie was a waste. You do not want people to feel that way about something
      you've written.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If you take nothing else from this class, take this: Spend the majority of
      your time working on the beginning and the end.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The strongest type of ending is the one that loops back around and
      reinforces something you said in the beginning, makes a connection no one
      saw coming, brings an unexpected detail back into play, or otherwise
      closes the story. If you end well, it satisfies the reader in a way that
      makes him feel like your writing was good. If you end poorly, no matter
      how good the rest was, he'll still be feeling like there's something
      missing about your writing - and by extension, about you.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Note the flip that came at the end of the mom story—that I was proud of
      her.

    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Study any good writing and you'll suddenly notice that the end is really
      what makes it, isn't it?
