      The art of pushing buttons
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Were you able to draw some absolute truths relating to:
    </p>
    <ol class="mt-20 mb-20 px-32 text-sm" type="1">
      <li>Your industry?</li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        Your customer's problems or need in relation to your industry?
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">What you're specifically selling them?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-lg">Let me ask you something: Was this easy or hard?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If it was easy, good. You're on the road to knowing your target market at
      the level you need to know them in order to push their buttons. If it was
      hard, I want to encourage you to go back through the first two lessons and
      really work on understanding the worldview and the beliefs of the people
      you're selling to.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-3xl text-center px-32">
      Because creating emotional appeal in your writing is precisely about that:
      Pushing buttons.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      And while pushing any old button might be fun, we need to be strategic
      about which buttons we're (deliberately) pushing, if we want those buttons
      to actually WORK.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      So in order to do that, we've got to know the landscape of our target
      market's heart. Which buttons on their heart are the ones
      <span class="italic">we want to be pushing</span>, wherein “the ones we
      want to be pushing” are defined as “the ones that will help them feel a
      soul-mate level match between them and you.”
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Everything I've asked you to do to this point is all pre-work necessary to
      figure out <span class="itallic">the right buttons.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Because once you know which buttons to push, we can determine how to use
      your words to push them.
