    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-5xl uppercase font-bold text-center">A story</p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Let's switch gears for a moment and take a Facebook post I wrote weeks
      ago, specifically to use as an example for this class.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 italic text-sm">
      Today would have been her 70th birthday. I'm wearing her gold aquamarine
      ring
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 italic text-sm">
      I'm wearing it to remember to be gentle, to slow down, and to offer every
      stranger who ever sets foot in your house the biggest Italian bread
      sandwich known to man.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 italic text-sm">
      To garden always (or at least try), to worship tomatoes, and to write
      fancy sick notes for my future children (complete with pressed flowers and
      calligraphy pens).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">
      To see the best in the cranky gas station attendant, to look them in the
      eye and see their human, to wear black and white as a religion, to sip
      water from fancy red brandy glasses, and to treat yourself even when you
      don't feel like you deserve it. (You do.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">
      To read more crime mysteries, to use paperbacks as a drug, put whip cream
      in your coffee, and to indulge in quiet time like other people indulge in
      happy hour.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">
      To sign your name with gorgeous intention (in particular when there are
      people in line behind you at the grocery store), to lovingly obsess over
      the details, to always let people have their moment, and to be classyâ€”even
      when you're angry.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">
      To pick a husband who will put you on a pedestal, to remember never to
      take him for granted, to love without judging, and to try not to judge
      much at all, period. (You never know someone's story.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">
      And most importantly, to put a wildly beautiful stamp on everything you
      do, and to live, live, live, not as much as you can afford, but as much as
      you can feel. Because as long as you feel something, the rest are just
      details.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">
      Love you, mom. A lot of people tell me that you'd be proud of me. But what
      they don't know is that everything I've accomplished has nothing to do
      with me, and everything to do with the way I was raised.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">And that being the case?</p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">I'm just as proud of you.</p>
    <p class="mt-3 mb-10 text-sm italic">Happy 70th birthday</p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      What do you feel when you read this? And more importantly,
      <span class="underline">why do you feel that way?</span><br />Analyze
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Do you know?</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Can you point to anything specific in the words that makes you feel that
      way?
    </p>
