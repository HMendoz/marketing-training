      Your target's worldview and what it means for what you're selling
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      As you can see, as made evident by the Don't Mess With Texas campaign,
      once again, the biggest piece to consider when making an emotional appeal
      to your audience is, in fact,
      <span class="italic">the audience themselves.</span> (You get this by
      now.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 italic text-lg text-3xl text-center px-32">
      We want to get your audience on board with your message, not by merely
      making your message interesting,
      <span class="underline"
        >but by making your message a part of their identity.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      We talked about this with hooks, and it's my hope that this section, and
      the sections that follow this lesson, will not only pave the way for you
      to flesh out some supporting emotional copy, but also go back and edit
      your hook further because, (I've said it once, and I'll say it again...and
      then again), the writing process is an editing process. And every step of
      The Six Appeal Process will force you to go back through your work,
      re-examine what you've written, and add in any new perspectives along the
      way.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Writing takes thought. It takes times. It takes second thought. It takes
      clarity, and more specifically, it takes clarity gained through thought.
      And it takes understanding that you probably won't get it right the first
      time around. But that's what they made the delete button for, isn't it?
      <span class="font-bold">Because delete is supposed to happen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Editing is supposed to happen. <span class="italic">Change</span> is
      supposed to happen. We're human and, while we're pretty darn good at
      speaking our own native languages, that isn't to say that we're experts at
      <span class="italic">using</span> that language.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      If our goal is to make your message a part of your target market's
      identity, how do we do that? What does that mean? How do we accomplish it?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Well, it's obvious that the only way we can align our message with our
      target market's identity is by first
      <span class="italic">understanding their identity.</span> Check. That's
      what the worldview piece of the puzzle was all about. We can't sell people
      who we don't understand. Not in real life, and certainly not with the
      written word.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">So here's what I want you to do.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      I want you to think about the work you did in the first two lessons. Think
      about the conclusions you were able to draw. And I want you to take a
      moment to outline some <span class="italic">absolute truths</span> about
      your target market. Things you know to be true about their worldview as it
      relates to what you're selling.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      We don't need to know about their worldview on everything right now; just
      how their worldview as a whole
      <span class="italic">affects what you're selling.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6">
      And then answer the following, using their worldview to guide your
      answers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">What does your reader think about:</p>
    <ol class="mt-20 px-32 text-sm">
      <li>Your industry?</li>
      <li class="mt-3">Their problem in relation to your industry?</li>
      <li class="mt-3">What you're specifically sellin them?</li>
    </ol>
