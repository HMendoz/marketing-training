      Unexpected Language
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">Let's go back to the Facebook experiment post.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">

      day. And lots of people say what you'd expect them to say.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-sm text-center px-32 italic">
      "I miss you."<br />"Thinking of you on this special day."<br />"Wish you
      were here."<br />"Not a day goes by that I don't think of you."<br />"You're
      always i nmy heart."
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">And the list goes on.</p>

      A hook only gets you so far; the rest is going to depend on how well you
      sell yourself <span class="underline">sentence by sentence</span>. And
      guess what? A whole series of sentences is called a story. You can now
      officially consider yourself an author. Not an author of fiction, but an
      author of truth - as it's seen through your target's eyes.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold">The most important truth of all.</p>
