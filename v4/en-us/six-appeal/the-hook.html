    <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-center">Step One: The Hook</h1>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      The very first step in The Six Appeal Process is called The Hook.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      Surely you can picture a fishing hook, how it's designed to catch the
      mouth of a fish and latc on, and that's precisely what an emotional hook
      is designed to do, too:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-20 mb-20 text-center text-lg">
      <span class="italic">Catch a reader's attention and</span> LATCH ON
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      With over 400 million tweets sent daily and 4.75 billion pieces of content
      shared on Facebook every day (holy maloney, right?),
      <span class="underline"
        >and only .5 seconds for someone to decide if they're going to stay on
        your website or leave</span
      >
      hooking someone isn't as easy as it once was. In the online landscape,
      where there's more opporunity than ever, there's also more noise than
      ever. So the only shot you have? Is to use your opening words as a weapon,
      and make sure the first thing anyone reads guarantess one thing:
      <span class="font-bold">That they'll read more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      The hook isn't just a headline; it's a theme. A message. A unifying idea
      that's going to help shape your brand, your message and your idea-and give
      everything else you write some cohesion.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      It's a statement, or a series of statements, that help make surprising new
      connections in the minds of readers, and serve as your thesis statement,
      so to speak. The underbelly of your work. Your message, distilled into a
      bundle of brilliance.
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold mt-10 text-lg">Brains love surprises.</p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      They're hardwired to pay attention because to the brain, a surprise means
      that you weren't prepared for something. And if you weren't prepared for
      something, <span class="italic">then you must know something.</span> So
      your brain kicks into high gear and sends attention span reeling for more.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      Translation: Your hook doesn't need to shock and awe, but it should
      contain an element of unexpected. Because surprise happens when a human's
      guessing mechanism fails.
    </p>
    <p class="text-3xl italic text-center font-bold mt-20 mb-20">
      Your job is to break the pattern.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">How do you do that?</p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      One way: <span class="italic">Violate the reader.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      Not like THAT. But violate in the sense that you completely throw off the
      schema of what their brain is automatically guessing is going to come next
      in a line, a sentence, a paragraph.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      When you help others view everyday or complex concepts in a new light,
      it's like they're seeing things for the first time, like a child.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      And as such,
      <span class="italic">it gives them a reason to pay attention to it.</span
      ><span class="font-bold"> This is key.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">Example hook statements:</p>
    <div class="text-center mt-10 text-lg">
      <p class="my-0">So you've got a great business.</p>
      <p class="my-0">Maybe even one of the best our there.</p>
      <p class="font-bold my-0">Who cares?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-center mt-10 text-lg">
      <p class="my-0">Happiness isn't earned, given or taken.</p>
      <p class="font-bold my-0">It's defined.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-center mt-10 text-lg">
      <p class="my-0">Design isn't just pretty.</p>
      <p class="font-bold my-0">It's POWER.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-center mt-10 text-lg">
      <p class="my-0">Brak up with paper.</p>
      <p class="font-bold my-0">Honeymoon with efficiency</p>
    </div>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      So what I want you to do in this first step is simple: Take whatever
      you're selling., whether it's a product, a service, your entire brand, or
      yourself, and come up with one statement or series of statements, a HOOK,
      if you will,
      <span class="underline"
        >designed to violate your target's expectations.</span
      >
      (You can use the following prompt to help.)
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold mt-10 text-lg">
      In order to violate expectations, you've got to know what the expectations
      are.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      Say you're writing a novel, even, and you've got to come up with a jacket
      description that's emotionally engaging. First consider your story and
      what's normal about it. It is a story about a girl who graduates college,
      hates corporate America, and decides to do something about it? Great.
      <span class="italic">But who cares?</span> That's nothing new. We've seen
      it coming and going. That isn't to say we can't tell that story, though.
      We merely need to determine how to take that same story, and develop a
      fresh approach to communicating it-and find a way to violate what we
      expect comes next. (As long as you aren't making it up, of course. In
      other words, you can't fabricate lies just for the sake of being
      suprising. You can only do that when talking to your ex-boyfriend.)
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold mt-10 text-lg">
      Don't forget the expectations you violate should be those of your target
      reader. Not your own.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      This is particularly relevant when we've got professionals and
      well-meaning folks who know their stuff so well, that they use a bunch of
      so well, that they use a bunch hof industry jargon, either because they're
      so used to their topic that they forget not everybody knows what they'r
      talking about, OR, because they're secretly competing with their peers and
      are worried about making the wrong right impression.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      (Hint: You don't care what your peers think; your goal is to write for the
      person who's going to pull money out of their pocket and give it to you.)
      Therefore, when you're considering how you can gracefully remember whose
      norms we're talking about.

          What could you say to violate the reader's expectation of what you're
          going to say? What can you say to evoke surprise? Create some
          cognitive dissonance? Suggest there's a better way?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="uppercase text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Example</p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      When writing a landing page for an email marketing intelligence agency,
      the norm for them would have been a movie trailer that went something
      like,
    </p>
    <blockquote class="mt-10 italic px-24">
      "Marketing managers cries at desk because revenue has dropped dramatically
      and she doesn't know what to do about it. So she takes out and ad in a
      magazine, costing the company thousands of dollars, and then hurries to
      send out "that pesky newsletter" that she forgot about 3 weeks in a row
      now, before rushing off to happy hour to forget about her woes.""
    </blockquote>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      The obvious, expected scene here is the marketing manager just haphazardly
      sending out a "newsletter" as if it were just an annotying task.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">So in coming up with a hook, I wrote this:</p>
    <blockquote class="mt-10 italic px-24">
      Free-wheeling your email marketing is like attempting to fly an airplane
      without knowing how-except the pilot isn't the only one in trouble. Your
      entire company is.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">
      It makes a clear analogy of something everyone can understan, (how
      terrible it would be trying to fly a plane by yourself), and also makes it
      clear that free-wheeling is not a samrt idea, and most importantly, I've
      just flipped the script from everything she's been thinking, giving her a
      reason to pay attention to me. Maybe the reason her revenue is suffering
      is because she is freewheeling her email marketing. Cue instant attention.
